How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Audacity, the audio voice changer, offers a ‘Change Pitch’ feature with which you can change the pitch of the audio without damaging its tempo. You can separately change the speed. With this feature, you can also adjust and play with the frequency and semitones.</p>
<p>The audio editor also features to estimate the starting pitch; for instance, if A3 is a quiet note, followed by a large and loud note like C4, Audacity will detect C4. In case both notes have the same volume, Audacity will detect A3. With Audacity, you also get the ‘To’ and ‘From’ controls if you plan to change the pitch manually. To learn more about changing pitch, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step 1: For changing pitch in Audacity, start by launching the software. After launching, you can either record the audio or else, from the ‘File’ section, you can also ‘Open’ any file from your device.</p>

How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?"></a>Part 3. How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?</h2><p>The most fun voice transformation is from low pitch to higher pitch. In general, modifying the male voice to a female voice, as the male pitch has a negative value and changing it to a positive pitch, modifies your voice to a female voice. What else could be better to use than the amazing Audacity voice changer? Let’s share the steps that will help you change your male voice to female.</p>
<p>Step 1: First, start by opening the Audacity audio editor. Once it has launched successfully, you should import the audio file. You can record audio with Audacity. Along with this, you can also import files from your device from the ‘File’ section, followed by the ‘Open’ option.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="upload audio track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After your audio track is visible on the timeline, you have to select the part of the file that you want to edit. You can easily select it by clicking and dragging the mouse. If not this, you can also work with the whole track; for this, simply click on the track name to select it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="select audio portion or whole"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After you are satisfied with the selection, head to the top menu and select the ‘Effects’ options. A drop-down list appears after this, and you have to look for the ‘Change Pitch’ option and select it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="choose change pitch effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Normally, you can adjust the pitch by taking help from the sliders, but you can also change the pitch manually by adding a percentage. The male pitch originally will have a negative value; change it and set a positive value. You can keep changing until you are satisfied.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Male-Voice-to-Female-Voice-with-Audacity-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Male-Voice-to-Female-Voice-with-Audacity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?"></a>Part 3. How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?</h2><p>The most fun voice transformation is from low pitch to higher pitch. In general, modifying the male voice to a female voice, as the male pitch has a negative value and changing it to a positive pitch, modifies your voice to a female voice. What else could be better to use than the amazing Audacity voice changer? Let’s share the steps that will help you change your male voice to female.</p>
<p>Step 1: First, start by opening the Audacity audio editor. Once it has launched successfully, you should import the audio file. You can record audio with Audacity. Along with this, you can also import files from your device from the ‘File’ section, followed by the ‘Open’ option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-8.jpg"
                      alt="upload audio track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After your audio track is visible on the timeline, you have to select the part of the file that you want to edit. You can easily select it by clicking and dragging the mouse. If not this, you can also work with the whole track; for this, simply click on the track name to select it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-9.jpg"
                      alt="select audio portion or whole"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After you are satisfied with the selection, head to the top menu and select the ‘Effects’ options. A drop-down list appears after this, and you have to look for the ‘Change Pitch’ option and select it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-10.jpg"
                      alt="choose change pitch effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Normally, you can adjust the pitch by taking help from the sliders, but you can also change the pitch manually by adding a percentage. The male pitch originally will have a negative value; change it and set a positive value. You can keep changing until you are satisfied.</p>

                      alt="increase the pitch"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Lastly, don’t forget to save the changes by hitting the ‘OK’ button at the button and saving the file to your respective device.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Create-Robot-Voice-in-Audacity-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Create-Robot-Voice-in-Audacity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to Create Robot Voice in Audacity?"></a>Part 4. How to Create Robot Voice in Audacity?</h2><p>As we have mentioned, Audacity is an audio voice changer, so you must know that Audacity also can change your voice into a robotic voice. Among the different voices, the robot voice sounds interesting, and it’s fun to create. If you are excited to learn to create robot voice in Audacity, follow the guiding steps shared below:</p>
<p>Step 1: For creating an extraordinary robotic voice, start by launching Audacity on your device. After it opens, it’s time to record your voice to create a robot voice. Or else, head to the ‘File’ tab and import your audio file from your device to Audacity from the ‘Open’ option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open your audio track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After this, to start the editing, you need a stereo track on the timeline. For doing this, navigate ‘Tracks’ from the top menu and click on it. Next, hover on the ‘Add New’ option to open its sub-menu. You will see the ‘Stereo Track’ option, select it, and copy-paste the audio file in the new section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select stereo track option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Let’s start with the fun part, the editing and adjusting different features. Start by opening the ‘Effects’ tab, and from the long list of options, select ‘Echo.’ There, you can enter the ‘Delay Time’ and change other fields as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust echo settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Preview the audio and move on to the next setting. Open the ‘Effects’ section and look for the ‘Change Pitch’ option. You can change and adjust the pitch according to your desire and preview the file again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="customize change pitch effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: For creating a robot voice, you can also set the tempo. For that, head to the ‘Change Tempo’ option under the ‘Effects’ section and set the value to minus. Keep adjusting the different effects until you get your perfect robot voice.</p>
