## How to uninstall Audacity Ubuntu

For whatever reason, if you wish to remove the Audacity program from your computer, you may follow these instructions.

### Method 1

If you installed Audacity through the Snap method, execute the following command in your terminal: **$ sudo snap remove Audacity**

**$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**

\>**Step** 2:

As of the right moment, the PPA has been withdrawn. What happens to the programs that are installed using these PPAs? Will they be eliminated as a consequence of the abolition of the Patriot Act? The answer is a resounding no.

# Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Using speech to text apps has become increasingly common. People use voice to text apps to compose business letters and memos, transcribe meetings to document discussions, write books; in short, just about anything they want to be laid out in the written form.

In most situations, a person can think and talk a lot faster than they can type or write. That is why using speech to text apps can speed up so many situations, either in a professional or personal setting. The problem is that using speech to text apps that are not of the highest quality can be a frustrating experience. The app may poorly transcribe what you are saying, or skip entire words altogether.

Rather than making your life easier, a poorly conceived speech to text app makes things even more complicated.

## Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

Below are the ten best speech to text apps that you can use to transcribe audio to text. These apps convert audio to text seamlessly and are available for Android or iOS devices.

### 1\. [SpeechTexter (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speechtexter.speechtexter)

SpeechTexter is a free app available on the Google Play Store that you can use to create text notes, sms, emails, or tweets using your spoken words.

There is also the possibility of creating your own commands for specific punctuation, along with adding unique words into the appâ€™s dictionary.

The software allows you to work with more than 60 languages, while the recognition percentage is around 95 percent for the English language. The app does require an internet connection to work at its best, as the accuracy is lower in offline mode.

### 2\. [Voice Notes (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SouthernPacificOceanFisher.VoiceToText%5Fmemo)

Voice Notes is available on the Google Play Store as a free download, but there are limits on how long you can record within the free version. Users who want access to the full version must pay the premium price of $3.

The app allows you to convert speech to text to create notes, reminders, and other documents. You can group documents based on categories, get support for up to 120 languages, and toggle between 20 different user interface languages as well.

### 3\. [Speechnotes (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.speechnotes.speechnotes&hl=en&gl=US)

Speechnotes is a free download on the Google Play Store, with the premium version and other features available as in-app purchases for anywhere from $0.99 to $7.99.

The speech to text app makes it effortless for you to create simple text notes with your voice, record longer conversations, transcribe interviews, and complete similar tasks. You can even backup the data you save to Google Drive to ensure you do not lose any of your audio files.

Speechnotes does allow you to use the app offline, but accuracy is a lot better online.

### 4\. [Voice Notebook (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook)

There is an offline mode, but it is only available for specific languages.

Using speech to text apps has become increasingly common. People use voice to text apps to compose business letters and memos, transcribe meetings to document discussions, write books; in short, just about anything they want to be laid out in the written form.

In most situations, a person can think and talk a lot faster than they can type or write. That is why using speech to text apps can speed up so many situations, either in a professional or personal setting. The problem is that using speech to text apps that are not of the highest quality can be a frustrating experience. The app may poorly transcribe what you are saying, or skip entire words altogether.

Rather than making your life easier, a poorly conceived speech to text app makes things even more complicated.

## Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

Below are the ten best speech to text apps that you can use to transcribe audio to text. These apps convert audio to text seamlessly and are available for Android or iOS devices.

## Audacity

![audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mp3-mixer-mac-1.jpg)

The first free MP3 music mixer for Mac that we have to consider is Audacity. Audacity is hard to miss because of how easy it is to use. Therefore, many people tend to recommend this software. Audacity is an open-sourced MP3 music mixer thatâ€™s entirely free to use. It has a straightforward and interactive user interface that supports the most popular file types, including MP3, WAV, OGG, MIDI, and many more.

With Audacity, you can record right in the app or edit existing files as you miss. It also comes with many effects that you can utilize to improve your MP3 file. Another unique tool on Audacity is the spectrogram that allows you to analyze the audio frequencies. Audacity supports up to 32-bit audio files making it a powerful MP3 music mixer for Mac users.

This MP3 music mixer is ideal for beginners as its features are easy to navigate. However, this doesnâ€™t mean that professional DJs and sound producers cannot also utilize this audio mixer. You can record audio to add to your MP3 using a mixer or a live microphone. It also lets you download digital recordings from social media platforms like YouTube. This free MP3 music mixer for Mac is a great option to explore.

 Pros

* It offers a spectrogram view to visualize frequencies
* It offers effects like Audio unity, which is specifically for Mac only
* Allows you to delete, cut, and merge clips

This is another impressive Mac MP3 music mixer you can use for free if youâ€™re doing non-commercial mixing. WavePad is remarkable because it supports many file types, so thereâ€™s no need to convert your MP3 to another format before mixing on WavePad. It also supports users working on multiple files simultaneously. This means you can process thousands of files at the same time while editing a file. In addition, WavePad offers a vast range of effects and supports audio bookmarking, which you would find very useful.

Other features these mixer offers are voice manipulation and text-to-speech functions. It is quite easy to use, making it an excellent option for beginners. Some of the effects people seem to love on this MP3 music mixer is the compression, noise removal, reverb, and many more. Thereâ€™s also the analysis tool that advanced users can utilize to mix and edit their MP3 files.

With WavePad, speed and pitch changes are entirely possible. It also supports audio scrubbing, which is very handy. However, this file doesnâ€™t support multi-tracking. Therefore, users can edit stereo or mono audio files on the software. Although its multi-window interface can take a while to get used to, this Mac MP3 music mixer is worth a try.

 Pros

* It is free for non-commercial use
* It comes with many impressive features
* Allows batch processing by users

Another free cross-platform MP3 music mixer is another excellent option for your Mac devices. It is a great option if youâ€™re looking for a budget-friendly option to edit and mix your MP3 files. This software supports many file types like MP3, WMA, FLAC, and many more. It also supports video formats if you also want to edit video files.

This MP3 music mixer comes with a clean and colorful user interface; it is easy to use and fast for mixing your MP3 files. WavePad has many effects like EQ, compression, and reverb, allowing you to tweak your MP3 files while mixing your music files. Unlike other MP3 mixers that are destructive when you are trying to edit the MP3 music file, this is not the case with Ocenaudio. With this software, you can tweak the parameters of the effect and hear the changes immediately.

Ocenaudio also supports VST; you can add your plugins when editing MP3 files. In addition, you can record audio straight in the software and use the spectrogram feature to visualize frequencies for advanced users. Professional music mixers would find this feature to be very welcoming.

Although it doesnâ€™t support multi-track sessions, which means you canâ€™t record several instruments and mix them, it is an excellent option for your mono file mixing. It is also quite simple to use compared to other basic MP3 music mixers for Mac.

 Pros

* It offers the spectrogram feature
* It is free to use
* Users can install their plugins
