Even though podcasts often have the form of a talk show, the topics podcasters cover in their shows range from presenting the latest music releases to discussing political topics. Listening to a podcast from a Smartphone without a player is not an option, which is why we made a selection of some of the best podcast player apps for iPhone and Android devices.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.
