##### Step 2 Detach Audio Track

This step is relevant to the users who are using a video that already has a soundtrack or effects. Here, you need to eliminate the unwanted noise or sound effects from the video file by separating both. You should put your cursor on the video and right-click. It will lead you to a quick menu panel having multiple options along with the “Detach Audio” option. If you are using desktop or windows for editing, you can use the Ctrl+Alt+D shortcut command. Detaching audio will provide all options, such as – editing, modifying, or deleting the audio file.

##### Step 3 Audio Keyframing

Some audio files have several sound effects or audio files. Here, it is important to focus on audio keyframing for impressive video outcomes. Here, you should proceed with audio keyframing, such as – fade in and fade out. It will make the transition of audio or sound effects smooth and better.

##### Step 4 Add Sound Effects

After all these things, now your video is ready for feature audio files. Here, you can proceed by choosing the Sound Effect option in the Audio tab. It will showcase a complete list of sound effects and audio files from the built-in library of Filmora. If you like effects from the library, you don’t need to whistle song download. All you have to do is drag sound effects from the library and set it up as per the video transitions.
