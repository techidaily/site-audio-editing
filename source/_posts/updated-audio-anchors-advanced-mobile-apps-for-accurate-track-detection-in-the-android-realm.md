There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.

You tried searching for that song in your phone's music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song's name or any definitive lyrics or the artist's name.

Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.

## Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021

Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.

### 1\. [Google App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US)

On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.

Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.

This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:

Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.

Step 2- Either click on the "Search a song" button or say "what's this song?" before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That's it. That's all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.

It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, "Hey Google, what's this song?" before humming the tune, and that's about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.

And don't worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.

### 2\. [Shazam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android)

Shazam music recognition app can identify your tune and song in seconds. You will get to find and listen to your desired song and get all related information like lyrics, videos, and artist's profile.

![Shazam: Discover songs & lyrics in seconds for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shazam-discover-songs-lyrics-in-seconds.jpg)

You can listen to the song on this song identifier app or add the song to your Spotify or Apple Music, or Google Play Music playlist. Shazam also allows you to watch music videos from YouTube and Apple Music.

The Pop-Up feature of Shazam is one of its best features. It enables you to identify music on any app like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. Besides, you can use the app offline and in the background to continue identifying songs even though the app is not in use.

The app will also notify you about your country's and city's current music scene, recommend playlists according to your tastes and lets you share songs on social media. The Shazam app has been downloaded over 200 million times in 150+ countries. This should convince you of the app’s credibility.

In 2018, Apple Inc. completed acquiring Shazam for $400 million dollars. Since, then Shazam comes integrated with iOS (version 14.2 and higher).

The unique feature of this song finder app is that it can turn any room into a discotheque. It has a flashlight party mode that emanates strobes of light in sync with the music being played. You can also share identified songs with your friends and family via social media.

### 4\. [SoundHound](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melodis.midomiMusicIdentifier.freemium)

You can also identify a song or a tune stuck in your mind by just humming it to the listening mode and SoundHound will do the rest.

All your song searches are stored so that you can replay them later without having to search for them all over again. The app has real-time lyrics that let you sing along your favorite song. Consequently, you can also search for lyrics of a particular song by using type search and voice search features of the app (which works like Google Assistant). You can use this voice search to conduct all types of searches on this song finder app.

You can transfer all your discovered songs to your Spotify playlist, provided you have accounts in both Spotify and SoundHound. Or you can play the discovered songs on SoundHound itself. You can also stream your Spotify playlist on SoundHound.

Apart from the above, you can get all related information on your discovered songs and share those songs with your friends and family via social media.

### 5\. [Genius – Song Lyrics & More](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genius.android&hl=en&gl=US)

Genius is more of a lyrics finder app than a song identifier app for Android. Its database contains lyrics of more than 1.7 million songs, and that database is entirely crowdsourced. Besides lyrics, you will get authentic information regarding the backstory of the songs on the database.

![Genius — Song Lyrics & More for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/genius-song-lyrics-app.jpg)

It is very simple to use the app. Just open the app, press the soundwave button and hold the phone near the source of the music. You will get lyrics and other information on that song in a matter of seconds.

Genius is run by the inputs of dedicated and obsessed music fans. So, if you fall into that category and want more to do with a song than just listening to it, then this is a must-have app for you.

### 6\. [MusiXmatch - Lyrics for your music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.musixmatch.android.lyrify&hl=en&gl=US)

What is best is that, the track can be playing on any music streaming app, and the floating widget of MusiXmatch will display the lyrics in sync with the song being played. Lyrics will appear embedded in YouTube music videos, whether they be in portrait or landscape mode.

It can also translate lyrics in real-time, thus enabling you to learn a new language while doing one of your favorite tasks listening to music. You can get the lyrics and translation of any song playing around you with a single tap. You can also find your favorite song by simply typing a single line of lyrics of that song.

The app also contains allied information on the identified songs. You can be a part of this app's community and feed this database with music knowledge and information, lyrics and translations.

You can stream MusiXmatch on television via Chromecast, and the app is available on all Android wearable devices. A premium version of this app allows you to view lyrics offline, removes advertisements from the app, and enables a party mode where themes play in sync with the song lyrics.

**Conclusion**

The world of music is vast and dynamic. There are hundreds of music genres, thousands of songs in each genre and billions of recorded songs if we take into account songs from every country and language in this world.

Finding your favorite songs in this musical universe is nothing short of a treasure hunt, especially if you know very little of your coveted song( like just a tune, a jingle, a single line of lyrics, or you just heard the song for the first time).

To assist you in this hunt are the above song finder apps and lyric finders. Use them, and no song will be beyond your reach.

## The Visual Symphony: Infusing Premiere Pro Projects with Animate Waveform Integration and Audio Representation

By using waveform of the sound waves in Premiere Pro, we can better edit audio. In the following article, we'll learn how the audio waveform auto-sync feature in Premiere Pro helps automatically align and merge clips in the Project panel, in the timeline, and when setting up a multicamera project and how to insert audio waveform on your clips using Premiere Pro.

## Part 1\. How to show Audio Waveform on clips in Premiere Pro? (2 ways)

Users frequently complain that the audio waveform can suddenly disappear while editing audio in Premiere Pro, which is quite annoying to deal with. In the following tutorial, I'm going to show you how to make the audio waveforms visible.

### 1\. Click the wrench icon on settings button

If you are not seeing them on audio clips on your timeline, then you drag on an audio clip to your timeline or your sequence and just click on the **wrench** and check to show audio waveform.

![click the wrench icon on settings button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-1.jpg)

Once you check that you should see the audio waveforms on your clip you can click it again you should see a checkmark and it is highlighted in blue and if you don't want to see them all you have to do is click it again.

![audio waveforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-2.jpg)

That will toggle off the audio waveforms and that is how to show the audio waveforms on your audio clips in adobe premiere pro.

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-3.jpg)

### 2\. Automatic generate audio waveform

Make sure **"Automatic audio waveform creation"** is selected by going to **"Edit > Preferences > Audio"** first. When importing files, no waveforms are generated if option is unticked. Only clips you import moving forward will be impacted by this; clips already imported won't be affected.

Second, for creating audio waveforms on clips that don't have them, select the clips in the Program panel and go to **“Clip > Generate Audio Waveform”**.

![select the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-4.jpg)

## Part 2\. How to add audio waveform animation in Premiere Pro?

If you want to simply add a dynamic effect to your audio, just follow the tutorial below.

##### Step1Click After Effects Composition

First, make sure both the video and audio are selected. Right-click and select replace with **After Effects composition**.

![click after effects composition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-5.jpg)

##### Step2Create a new solid in After Effects

After creating a new project in After Effects, you need to choose a new solid of any color in your composition.

![create a new solid in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-6.jpg)

##### Step3Open audio waveform effect

Search audio waveform and drag and drop this effect on your solid. The waveform will now respond to the audio in your film if you use the audio layer option for your clip in the effect parameters for your solid change.

![open audio waveform effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-7.jpg)

##### Step4Adjust the audio waveform effect

The position of the waveform on your video can be changed by utilizing the start and end point settings. Make sure the last values for each selections are the same to maintain an even level. Next, you can change the characteristics to give your waveform the desired appearance. Here, I applied some fundamental settings that are effective for singing. Using the two-color picker options and the display options, you may also change the waveform's inner and outer colors.

![adjust the audio waveform effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-8.jpg)

##### Step5Check the animation and export the video

Back in Premiere, you can pick whether you want the traditional analog lines to appear or a more contemporary digital waveform. Your clip will now be replaced with an After Effects composition that is dynamically tied to the audio waveform.

![check the animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-9.jpg)

## Part 3\. How to change the incorrect audio waveform in Premiere Pro?

These problems typically result from corrupted cache/peak files. If you have cleared the cache from the application. I will recommend cleaning them manually by going to the location specified in **“Preferences > Media Cache”**.

Clean the contents of the folder named Media Cache, Media Cache files, and Peak files (Before cleaning them, please ensure to open these folders once and verify if they have any of the media files in them to avoid any accidental deletion of required media or asset).

![media cache files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-10.jpg)

Please make sure that the option **“Save.cfa and.pek cache files next to the original media files when possible”** is unchecked. If it is ticked, you will have to remove them by hand from the folders where the media files are kept.

![media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-11.jpg)

The Audio previews can also be cleaned **(File > Project Settings > Scratch Disks > Audio Previews).**

The following time you open the project, these files will be cleared. Rebuilding the necessary cache and peak files could take some time.

## Part 4\. How to add audio waveform animation to video with Premiere Pro alternative?

In reality, based on the above process, it is clear that you must use After Effects to add audio waveform animation effects in Premiere Pro. Although you can further modify the animation, this approach is very difficult for beginners to understand, and it has a high learning cost.
