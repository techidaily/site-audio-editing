# The Best Song Finder Apps to Recognize Music on Android

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.

You tried searching for that song in your phone's music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song's name or any definitive lyrics or the artist's name.

Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.

## Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021

Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.

### 1\. [Google App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US)

On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.

Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.

This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:

Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.

Step 2- Either click on the "Search a song" button or say "what's this song?" before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That's it. That's all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.

It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, "Hey Google, what's this song?" before humming the tune, and that's about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.

And don't worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.

### 2\. [Shazam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android)

Shazam music recognition app can identify your tune and song in seconds. You will get to find and listen to your desired song and get all related information like lyrics, videos, and artist's profile.

![Shazam: Discover songs & lyrics in seconds for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shazam-discover-songs-lyrics-in-seconds.jpg)

You can listen to the song on this song identifier app or add the song to your Spotify or Apple Music, or Google Play Music playlist. Shazam also allows you to watch music videos from YouTube and Apple Music.

The Pop-Up feature of Shazam is one of its best features. It enables you to identify music on any app like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. Besides, you can use the app offline and in the background to continue identifying songs even though the app is not in use.

The app will also notify you about your country's and city's current music scene, recommend playlists according to your tastes and lets you share songs on social media. The Shazam app has been downloaded over 200 million times in 150+ countries. This should convince you of the app’s credibility.

In 2018, Apple Inc. completed acquiring Shazam for $400 million dollars. Since, then Shazam comes integrated with iOS (version 14.2 and higher).

### 3\. [BeatFind Music Recognition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beat.light)

The Beatfind Music recognition app for Android is one of the best song identifier apps out there. It is straightforward to use; just switch on the app's listen mode and let it process the yet unidentified music or song playing around you, and the app will identify it almost instantly.

![BeatFind Music Recognition for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beatfind-music-recognition.jpg)

You can gather information about the song, the artist and be notified about the top tracks recorded by him/her. Beatfind will allow you to play a preview of the song on the app so that you can be sure that this is the song you are looking for and then you will have the option to listen to the full track on Deezer or Spotify or YouTube. It records your searches so that it is easier for you to find a song later.

The unique feature of this song finder app is that it can turn any room into a discotheque. It has a flashlight party mode that emanates strobes of light in sync with the music being played. You can also share identified songs with your friends and family via social media.

### 4\. [SoundHound](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melodis.midomiMusicIdentifier.freemium)

SoundHound is simple to use and has a host of features that give you a complete music experience. It has over 300 million users.

Consequently, you can also search for lyrics of a particular song by using type search and voice search features of the app (which works like Google Assistant). You can use this voice search to conduct all types of searches on this song finder app.

You can transfer all your discovered songs to your Spotify playlist, provided you have accounts in both Spotify and SoundHound. Or you can play the discovered songs on SoundHound itself. You can also stream your Spotify playlist on SoundHound.

Apart from the above, you can get all related information on your discovered songs and share those songs with your friends and family via social media.

### 5\. [Genius – Song Lyrics & More](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genius.android&hl=en&gl=US)

There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.

You tried searching for that song in your phone's music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song's name or any definitive lyrics or the artist's name.

Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.

## Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021

Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.

Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.

Step 2- Either click on the "Search a song" button or say "what's this song?" before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That's it. That's all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.

It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, "Hey Google, what's this song?" before humming the tune, and that's about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.

02 [The Difference Between Noise and Distortion](#part2)

03 [How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video](#part3)

## What Is Distortion in Audio?

You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.

Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.

While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.

A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.

In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.

## The Difference Between Noise and Distortion

Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let's look at the differences between noise and distortion.

#### 1\. Where It Appears in a Signal

Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.

#### 2\. How It Affects Signals

Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.

#### How It's Measured

You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal's waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal's magnitude and frequency content over time.

Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.

## What Is Distortion in Audio?

You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.

Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.

While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.

A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.

In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.

Whether you are in the business of shooting or editing, noisy or distorted footage is among the most frustrating roadblocks you'll ever encounter in your workflow. The magic of filmmaking lies after the scenes in post-production. You can remove distortion from audio using various methods.

## What Is Distortion in Audio?

You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.

Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.

While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.

A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.

In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.

## The Difference Between Noise and Distortion

Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let's look at the differences between noise and distortion.

#### 1\. Where It Appears in a Signal

Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.

#### 2\. How It Affects Signals

Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.

#### How It's Measured

You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal's waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal's magnitude and frequency content over time.

Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.

## How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video

You can use several different methods to remove audio distortion in your video. They include:

### Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool

You can use an online distortion tool to fix this problem. One of the popular tools for removing distortion from audio is Audacity. Available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other Unix-like operating systems, Audacity is a FOSS (free and open-source digital audio editor software). It is also a recording application software, and you can use the program for varying tasks, including conversing audio files, removing audio distortion, adding effects, and mixing audio clips.

Keeping this in mind, let's look at how to remove distortion from audio using Audacity.

1. The first step is opening the file. To do this, drag and drop the audio file into Audacity.
1. Next, you need to select the distorted area before clicking on Effect. Once you have done this, click on the Noise Reduction option.

![remove audio distortion from video using audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/remove-distortion-from-audio-1.png)

1. Doing this will open the Noise reduction window.
2. Go to the Noise Profile and click on it; this will allow Audacity to know what it should filter out.

![remove audio distortion from video using audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/remove-distortion-from-audio-2.png)

1. Now, select the whole audio before reopening the Noise Reduction Window. Set the values as you see necessary.
2. Check the audio by clicking Preview. If you are satisfied with the results, click OK.
3. Be sure to apply the filter again if your audio is still distorted. Avoid doing it excessively, as the audio could be degraded. In turn, this can lead to the voice sounding robotic and tinny.

### Method 2: Software Solutions - Adobe Audition

You can remove distortion from audio using specialized audio editing software. One of the professional audio tools that you can use to fix audio distortion is Adobe Audition; this software allows you to carve out any unwanted sound for impressive results.
