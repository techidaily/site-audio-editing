 Sometimes the audio of the media files is too loud no matter how much you lower the volume on your speakers. Sometimes it’s because the video source itself was too quiet, or it was encoded at a loud volume. Although these media files come in many different formats, the method for lower the volume is relatively simple and universal. Using a video editing program like [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you will simply take advantage of the audio editor within the program to lower the volume. Here is a step-by-step guide to tell you how to lower volume in the media files.
