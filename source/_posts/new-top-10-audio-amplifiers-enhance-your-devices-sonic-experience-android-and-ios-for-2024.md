 A quick exploration of the Play Store provides a wide range of apps for Android and iOS devices that can enhance sound performance via the headphone jack and speakers. However, many apps fail to deliver on their promises and do little to boost the audio level of your devices. Furthermore, a few of these apps are complete with ads that often appear, drawing attention away from the customer experiences. With that in mind, we've come up with a list of **sound booster apps** for Android and iOS that work perfectly and optimize your respective device's audio output.
