The app supports wav, mp3, ogg and flac audio file formats, but if you are using a large audio file reversing a song may take some time. A three-minute song can temporarily take up to 20MB of storage space on your phone’s memory card, while longer songs may take even more, so it is important to make sure that you have enough free space on your phone before you start using this app.

**Conclusion**

Playing songs or audio effects backwards can have unexpected results, which makes the process of reversing audio incredibly entertaining. These free and easy to use audio reversers can help you create high-quality sound effects that might make the videos you used them for, go viral.
