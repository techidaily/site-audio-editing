### Audio Extraction Process

The audio extraction procedure is a great way to lubricate the editing process. The audio is extracted to add new audio master clips in this phenomenon. The channel mapping, duration, gain, speed, and footage adjustment are applied to the extracted clips. The original content remains preserved.

Before detaching audio, let us shift our focus to extracting it. So, are you with us? Follow the step-by-step below to extract audio from the video.

Step 1: Launching Premiere Pro

Open Adobe Premiere Pro. Press 'New Project' from the interface that appears. The default settings are good to go. However, make sure that the output location is appropriate. Hit 'OK.'

Step 2: Importing the Clips

Now, click on 'Media Browser' from the middle panel. Import the targeted video clips to initiate the process. Select the videos whose audio has to be extracted. Head to the 'Clip' section and choose 'Audio Options.' Hit 'Extract Audio' afterward.

Step 4: Exporting Process

### Audio Detaching Process

Step 1: Importing the Media Files

Launch Premiere Pro from your computer. The interface opens up in seconds. The user is recommended to browse the targeted video with attached audio. Add it to the timeline of the Premiere Pro.
