## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png)

**Step 4:** Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.

**Step 5:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

### 2\. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself

Furthermore, you can adjust the parameters to recalculate the silence detection or manually fine-tune what the feature has already detected

![detect the silent and low sound points](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/silence-detection-2.jpg)

once everything sounds good, export the video into the Filmora timeline so you can continue editing your video.

Moreover, Filmora also has another feature called "Audio ducking". Audio ducking is a way to turn down the volume of the background when one voiceover comes on.

How to use audio ducking with Filmora

Step1 Let's say you already have your voiceover and the audio in your video. If you want you to use duking voice feature, firstly, you need to decide which part of the audio you want to lower. After that, double-click the selected part until the ducking voice feature comes out.

![use duking voice](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/audio-ducking.jpg)

Step2 Next, you just need to drag the audio ducking bar to the left or right. Indeed, if you drag to the right, it will lower the audio. Once you are done adjusting the audio, click "Ok", and you can preview the result.

Last but not least, Filmora has other features called TTS and STT. Speech to Text (STT) allows you to transcript voice to subtitles in one click. Using speech-to-text will save you a lot of time on subtitling and speed up the editing process. Meanwhile, Text to Speech (TTS) is a feature in Filmora that lets you turn text files into voiceover and add more elements to your video.

How to use STT with Filmora

Step1 Firstly, right-click on the audio track and choose "Speech-to-Text".
