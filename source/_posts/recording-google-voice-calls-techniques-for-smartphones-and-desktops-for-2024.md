Do an internet search, and you'll come up with plenty of sites that offer them as downloads. Note that not all of those websites will be completely free; those that only provide their glass-breaking sounds for certain uses may charge a fee after using it more than a certain number of times.

With features like manual mode and glass-breaking sound effects, you can easily create videos. Hope this article helps you with collecting glass breaking/shattering sound effects and adding them into videos using Filmora.
