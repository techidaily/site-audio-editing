Have you ever wondered how your voice would sound if you were a kid? With MagicaCall –Voice Changer App, you easily find out since the app lets you modulate your voice or switch between different voice options during a call.

You can also play sound emoticons like a kiss or a clap while the call is in progress to create a comical effect. There are several subscription options available, and you must select one if you want to have access to all of the app’s features.

### How to modulate a voice during a call?

You will have to take the exact steps to modulate your voice during a call depending on the voice changer application you installed on your device. Most of these applications offer preset voices you can apply with a single tap and let you switch between effects so your representative can sound differently during the same conversation.
