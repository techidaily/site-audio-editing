### Step 2: Drag the Music File

You can locate the file from your device for importing it. Once the file has been imported successfully, it will appear in the ‘Folder’ section under Project Media. From there, you have to drag it to the timeline so that you can now slow down the music.

### Step 3: Slow Down the Speed

To slow down the music, click on the audio file in the timeline. From this, a menu will get highlighted above the timeline. From that menu, select the ‘Speed’ option. A sub-menu will show up, from which you should hit the ‘Custom Speed’ option.
