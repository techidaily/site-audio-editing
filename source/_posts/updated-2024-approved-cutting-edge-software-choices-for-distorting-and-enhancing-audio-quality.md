Even though you can use this platform for free, there are a few subscription plans you can choose from in case you want to download premium media assets or gain access to the platform’s standard library. Furthermore, the free version of Filmstock doesn’t offer any glitch sound effects, so if you want to download audio effects like Lazer Blast, Static Disturbance or Sci-Fi Glitches you will have to opt for a subscription plan that enables you to gain access to these effects.

Since Filmora V10.5 and later version, the Filmstock stock library has been intergrated into Filmora, which allows you to search the media, effect in Filmora directly without paying first.

**Conclusion**

Finding the sound effects that match the glitches you add to your videos has never been easier, as you just have to browse through an online library and download an effect that you like. Which website do you use to discover new glitch sound effects? Leave a comment and let us know.
