This tool will transcribe everything you say, although its accuracy depends on the quality of the audio recording. In addition, the Voice Typing feature can be used to transcribe the podcasts you already recorded, but you have to repeat exactly what is being said in the episode you are transcribing.

### Utilizing YouTube to Transcribe Podcast

One of the easiest ways to create captions for YouTube videos is to utilize the platform’s Transcribe feature. Every time you upload a new podcast to your YouTube channel, you’ll be able to generate captions for that video file automatically.

However, the [voice to text technology](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) the platform is using doesn’t always create accurate transcriptions, which is the reason why you must go through the entire transcription and make sure that the text matches its source.

Moreover, YouTube recently made the automatic captioning feature available during live streams, which enables you to generate transcriptions of your podcasts even while the recording session is in progress.

**Conclusion**

Extending the reach of your audience is an essential step towards creating a loyal base of subscribers who follow your work. Transcribing each episode of the podcast you are running can help you improve your SEO strategy and draw more attention to your work.
