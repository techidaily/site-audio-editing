With the MP3 Trimmer, you will be able to remove the undesired portion of the audio file, add some fade-in/fade-out effects, change gain and add silence. If you have a couple of large audio files that needs to be split, then you can benefit from the batch-edit feature of the MP3 Trimmer. It also has built-in tools that will help you analyze and repair broken audio files. It is free to use as long as you want.

### 5\. [AudioSlicer for Mac](http://audioslicer.sourceforge.net/)

AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI app for Mac OS X. It's designed to find all the silences in an MP3 file. It also allows you to split the audio file and tag them properly. While there are other audio splitter Mac apps that can do the tasks automatically according to specific criteria, AudioSlicer displays the silences within the specified duration. It allows you to listen to the audio before and after the silence. Then you can decide if you want to do the split at that point. Splitting of the file is done without any loss to the quality because there is no decoding or re-encoding of the audio file during the process. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 and above and supports both Intel Macs and PowerPC.
