It’s been some time since people have been receiving information in the form of audio files. From college lectures and audible notes to project meetings, interviews, etc. a large amount of information is being shared through audios. But audio files make it hard to access the information whenever you choose as it can be buried in hours of recordings.

So there is a need to convert these audios into texts. Texts are easy to access and it is also possible to selectively choose the information you need whenever you need it.

But you might be worrying about how to convert hours of recordings to texts. Don’t worry, due to the advancement of technology, there are now a lot of applications available to us that can **transcribe audio to text** free.

## How to Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android and iOS
