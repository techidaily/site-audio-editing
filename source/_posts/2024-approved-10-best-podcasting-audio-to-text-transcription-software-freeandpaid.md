## Explore & Download the Latest Electronic Dance Music (EDM)

Party background music is a constant form of entertainment. It has been there for as long as we can remember. We tend to connect to a particular kind of DJ. Of all the different genres, most of the artists and genres are inspired by Rock n' Roll. Party background music adds life to all the stories and moments. But where and how to get it?? Let's find out.

## Part 1: How to Find the Best DJ Music?

Regardless of age and favourite genre, we all enjoy a good DJ. There's this magic about good tunes, sound and connectivity; electronic background music makes us go gaga.

Are you also on the lookout for electronic background music? Do you want to build a rocking collection without spending much? With the abundance of resources on the internet, DJs have a vast opportunity to discover and download sounds for free. Let’s have a look-

### Streaming Platforms

Many sites have enormous libraries for DJs to create DJ background music. But today, these are replaced by the most fantastic streaming services like Spotify and Apple music.

You can hunt for DJ songs on these, but you'll have to download the files from another service if you do not have a compatible DJ programme. But these days, even these platforms are finding their way into DJ software.

The easier and best way is to explore the playlists that already exist on these apps. This way, you can discover new songs for DJ's based on the listening trends of the audience.

To change your voice, follow the steps below:

**Step 1:** You need to import the audio or recorded voice-over file, or you can even record your voice. Filmora also has the option to change the pitch of the voice. There are four different options for changing the speed of your desired voice.

**Step 2:** After you are finished editing your video or audio, you can save it in multiple videos and MP3 audio format and can also export the file to your computer.

An additional feature of Filmora is that it allows you to upload to social media in high quality and can compress the videos to different Android and iOS devices.
