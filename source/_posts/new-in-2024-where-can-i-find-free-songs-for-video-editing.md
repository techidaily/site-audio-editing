### **FAQs about Free Audio Editors**

#### 1\. What is the best software to edit audio?

It depends on your needs. If you are looking for the best free software to edit audio, Audacity is a great choice. However, if you work in the music industry, Adobe [Audition](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is very popular among musicians due to its irreplaceable functionalities.

#### 2\. Is GarageBand better than Audacity?

Both GarageBand and Audacity are the most commonly used free audio editing tools. However, they differ in several aspects. GarageBand can only work on macOS and iOS products, but Audacity can work on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Then one of the biggest differences between them is GarageBand is remarkable for making music, but Audacity is more like an audio editing tool. That's why we can't simply say GarageBand is better than Audacity because everyone has different purposes when choosing tools.

#### 3\. Can I record my voice over a music file using WavePad?

You cannot record your voice directly over the music file with WavePad; however, you can create a second voice file and combine the tracks using the Paste Mix tool.
