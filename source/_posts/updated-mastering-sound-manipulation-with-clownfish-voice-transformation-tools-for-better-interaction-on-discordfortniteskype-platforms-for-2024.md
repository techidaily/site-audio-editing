Working with audio files in Adobe After Effects would be challenging since it is basically a visual effects and motion graphics software, but audio can be added to a video in After Effects by the following method we are going to introduce in this guide.

---

## How to Add Audio in After Effects

1\. Start the program and open a new project.

2\. Import the files in the project panel. Mute the video sound if neccesary

![add audio in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-in-after-effects.jpg)

3\. Import the audio file to the project file as well (that is required to be added).

4\. Make sure to convert the audio file to .mp3 format.

5\. Drag and drop the audio onto the composition.

**To preview the audio in After Effects,** enable the audio in the timeline first and then Press cmd+0 on Mac to preview.

6\. Adjust the audio settings. Double click "L" on you keyboard to show the audio waveform.
