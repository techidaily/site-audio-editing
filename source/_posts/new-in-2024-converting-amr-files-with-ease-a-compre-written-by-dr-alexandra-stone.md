A typical AMR speech codec will have a multi-rate of eight bitrate values that range from 4.75kb/s to 12.2 kb/s. The structure of AMR allows the creation of a group of 160 twenty millisecond long samples by the codec in one frame. The multi-rate codec available for normal AMR files include ACELP, DTX, CAD and CNG.

In addition to compressing speech, the AMR file format can also be used for the storage of spoken audio using the same codec. There are a number of modern telephones that has the capability to store short audio recordings using the AMR format. There are also other programs, both free and proprietary that can be used to convert files from this format to other various formats and vice versa.

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

● Once the right video file is selected, you need to click on the Choose File option under the Audio File section. Then, like the video file, browse and choose the audio file you want to add to your video.

● Now, change the Options toggle to Replace Audio in Video or as you prefer. You can also change the Volume and Position options as desired.

● Finally, click on the Add button to insert music into your video file. Once the video is edited and music has been added, you can then download it on your computer right away.

## Part 3 Free Music Video Editor App

Even though online video editors do not require a powerful computer, you will still need a computer for using them. And since not everyone has a computer, this can be a huge issue for many users. However, if you upload video files on social media websites, you certainly have a smartphone with you. In that case, you will be glad to know that you can even edit videos on your mobile device. This is made possible thanks to the various free music video editor app options.

While there are many video editors for mobile devices, the [Mast Music Video Status Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mast.status.video.edit&hl=en%5FIN&gl=US) is a great option for most. It offers a wide range of templates, video effects, music tracks, stickers, color filters, etc. And since it also has an easy-to-use interface, it is one of the best music video animation maker apps for mobile devices. Even though it is quite straightforward to insert video and audio files in this app for combining them, you can go through the following instructions if you are confused:

● Inside the Mast Music Video Status Maker app, you can find the Add button to import all of your video files.

● Once that is done, go to the Music icon tab, where you can find a wide range of popular music tracks.

● If you want, you can also import music files from your smartphone.

● After that, add the music file under your video file and adjust its position.

● At last, save the video on your phone to share it on any social media platform of your choice.

### Conclusion

You can find video files on all kinds of online social media platforms. These are great for both entertainment and for learning new things online. Moreover, sharing videos with your friends can also be a great way to connect with them. Although, to ensure that you are sharing high-quality videos, you must use a music adder to video tool. Even a high-quality video won’t look the same without the right music.
