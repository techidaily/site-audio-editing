 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

If you are looking for a guide on **how to record a podcast**, you are on the right platform. If you are still looking on whether to start a podcast or not, this is the right time to discover a less competitive yet high potential niche.

Start developing new skills before anyone else could and be pro within no time. A podcast creation is the journey of many stages, including selecting the topic, name, podcast cover art, equipment, intro/outro audio, recording/editing equipment, and the promotion strategy. Thus, you must select the type of content beforehand to start recording the podcast effortlessly.

On the other hand, don't get too complicated, especially when you are a beginner. This post is going to be an ultimate guide on how to record a podcast effortlessly. Without further introspection, let's get started with the initial preparations.

* [Part 1:How to Prepare for Recording a Podcast?](#part1)
* [Part 2:How to Record a Podcast on PC?](#part2)
* [Part 3:How to Record a Podcast on the iPhone?](#part3)
* [Part 4:How to Record a Podcast Remotely?](#part4)

## How to Prepare for Recording a Podcast?

To know how to record a podcast remotely, you must note the initial steps of preparation. And that is going to include content selection to choosing the right recording equipment.

**Plan the content**

The very first step is to plan the content of the podcast. Also, make sure that the topic or niche you will select must be up to your knowledge. It should be a topic for which you can discuss 100+ episodes. Invest the right amount of time in planning the content of the podcast.

**Choose co-host (optional)**

You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.

**Select the format, style, and length of the podcast**

After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.

**Consider Podcast Recording Equipment**

Don't think of investing in a fancy podcast recording studio, especially when you are starting. Professionals even say that the outdoors is useful when you are confident to speak in public. It will also offer a preview of the background hustle, which further looks attractive and engaging to the listener.

You can even start from a phone with a good microphone setup. It’s better to invest in a good-quality microphone and have your little format ready all by itself. Try looking for an audio mixer if you have gone a bit advanced in podcast recording.

**Recording Software**

The last decision before recording is the selection of recording software. As a beginner, we'd like to recommend Audacity, a free tool when working on audio podcasts. Or, you must check out Wondershare Filmora X to beautify your video podcasts.

**Choose co-host (optional)**

You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.

**Select the format, style, and length of the podcast**

After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.
