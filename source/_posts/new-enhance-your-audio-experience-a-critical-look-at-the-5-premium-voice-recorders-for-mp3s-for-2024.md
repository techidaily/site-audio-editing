* **Compatibility:** You’ll want the software to be compatible with the format you are recording or obtaining the tracks. For the most part, audio editing software is quite adaptable, but certain types of tracks may not be compatible. So, check it out before you make your choice.
* **Sharing Capacity: The editing software must output** in a format that can be shared easily. So, you will want to look for systems compatible with what you are using.
