The amount of video content on the Internet is staggering, as hundreds of hours of videos are uploaded to platforms like YouTube, Vimeo or Twitch every day. Going the extra mile and doing all you can to produce videos that are going to attract the attention of online viewers can prove beneficial for numerous reasons.

Editing videos to the beat of the music in Final Cut Pro and other non-linear video editing apps can be a good way to create potentially viral videos. That’s why in this article we are going to show you how you can sync video to the music beat and make dynamic videos in Final Cut Pro X.

## How to Sync Videos to the Beat of a Song in Three Different Ways

Editing a video to the beat of a song requires some previous preparation because you must have all the materials in place before you start adding footage to the FCPX’s timeline. Most importantly the song you choose as a soundtrack for your video needs to have a rhythm you can use to easily sync videos and make cuts so that they match the song’s beat perfectly. So let’s have a look at three different techniques you can use to edit to the beat of a song.

### Add Markers Manually and Snap Videos to the Beats of a Song

Once you’ve imported all of your footage into a project you created in FCPX, you should place the song you want to use in your video to the audio track on the timeline. You must then isolate the audio file by either clicking on the **Solo icon** that looks like headphones on the editor’s timeline, selecting the Solo option from the Clip menu or using the **OPTION + S** keyboard shortcut.

Play the audio file you isolated and start adding markers at the beats in the songs where you want to make cuts. It is worth noting that you don’t have to add a marker at each beat, and you should listen to the song a few times in order to find perfect spots where you are going to make the cuts. Place the playhead at the beginning of the audio file, click on the **Play button**, and press the **M key** to start adding markers. You can count on the beat or tap your foot in order to make keeping up with the pace of the beats easier. Switching to the waveform view can also help you add markers more accurately and reduce the amount of time you have to spend searching for a beat.

Proceed to **disable the Solo option** after you add all markers to the song, and use the **N keyboard shortcut** to activate the **Snapping feature** before you add video clips to the timeline. Afterward, simply arrange the clips in the order you want them to appear in the video and preview the results. If some cuts are not positioned perfectly you can easily readjust them so that they are synced to the beat of the song.

A little complicated for you? Then try Filmora, a beginner-friendly tool, and do it in an easy.

### Cut to the Beat and Sync Audio with Video in FCPX

Final Cut Pro X doesn’t allow its users to line up their cuts automatically, which is the reason why you have to go through this process manually. Click on the **Titles and Generators icon** and then place the **Custom generator** to the video track on the timeline.

You should then add the song you want to use in your video to the audio track, connect it to the Custom generator and make sure that the duration of these two files matches. Listen to the song a few times before selecting both the generator and the audio file and then hold the **Command button and press the B button** to make cuts at beats throughout the song.

Drag a video clip from the Media Library and hold it over the section of the Custom generator until you see the **Film Strip icon**. Drop the video clip and select either the **Replace from Start, Replace from End or Replace with Retime to Fit** options. Keep adding video clips to this until you replace all parts of the generator with the footage you want to include in your video.

![Enhance2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Enhance2.jpg)

You can also delete cuts you’ve made on the generator by simply selecting the start or the end of a generator clip and pressing the delete button on the keyboard. Choose the Replace with Retime to Fit option in case a video clip is shorter than the segment of the generator you are trying to replace. FCPX will automatically slow down your clip and extend it to fit between two cuts. Optionally, you can use the Trim tool to align your cuts to the beats of the song perfectly, if they are a bit off, before previewing and exporting the video you created.

The [BeatMark X](https://ulti.media/beatmark-x-beat-markers-for-final-cut-pro/) application offers a solution to this problem for just $3,99\. This app analyzes songs, adds markers at the beats and lets you create XML files you can easily import into FCPX.

After installing BeatMark X, you should launch the app and drop the audio file you would like to analyze into the **Music File** box. Select the project’s **frame rate** and click on the **BeatMark button** to start analyzing the song.

The app will identify beats in a song and export an XML file to the same folder in which an audio file you analyzed is located. Head over to FCPX, click on the **File menu**, expand the **Import** submenu, choose the **XML** option and select the file you created with BeatMark X.

A new event that has the same name as the audio file you analyzed will be added to the media library. The event will contain a project, and you just have to open this project in order to see the song as well as the markers placed at every beat of the song. You can then proceed to add the video clips to the project in which the analyzed audio file is located or copy the song to any other project you created in FCPX.

## Unlocking Your Library: The Ultimate Techniques for Extracting Spotify Tracks

When you rip music from a CD or an app, you're copying songs from a source to your PC. During the ripping process, the ripping software compresses each song and stores it on your drive as a Windows Media Audio (WMA), WAV, or MP3 file. The era of CDs and cassettes is long gone today; we talk about music apps and how to extract mp3 sounds from them.

#### In this article

01 [What Is Spotify Ripper?](#part1)

02 [How to Rip Spotify Music on Windows and Mac?](#part2)

03 [How to Rip Music from Spotify Online?](#part3)

## Part 1\. What Is Spotify Ripper?

We all know Spotify is a fantastic app to listen to music, but it only works online. So, if you wish to listen to songs while you aren't connected to the internet, you have one option. You can rip audios using a full feature Spotify music ripper to get unlimited playback on all devices. Save the audio files in MP3, FLAC and other formats. Let's see how you can go about ripping songs from Spotify.

## Part 2\. How to Rip Spotify Music on Windows and Mac?

If you like some playlists or songs on Spotify, you might want to listen, download and save them on a computer. But to do this, you have to subscribe to the app. However, premium users can play and download songs on the app itself. They can't listen to them on other music players. So, you may ask if there is a way to rip and save Mp3 songs from Spotify to the computer for free?

Yes! If you find the right Spotify ripper, you can enjoy music anywhere offline without any limitations. Let's have a look at these five powerful rippers that allows you to rip from Spotify.

### Method 1\. Try A Streaming Audio Recorder

This is a perfect Spotify ripper for Windows and MAC. It can record any sound and save it in MP3, M4A, and other formats. You can adjust the output audio quality using this tool.

It streamlines downloading music from Spotify and many other various online sources. It has an intuitive interface, so it helps the users access it quickly. Every song you record gets saved with the details like song name, artist, and album title. This enables the users to track the recordings. If you are thinking of using this software for a long time, purchase the full version because the free tool only lets you record a few points.

[Wondershare DemoCreator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/) has a good set of features. It runs smoothly and does the work in the best way. Simply launch the software on your computer and stream the songs you like to save them to your device. Find the recorded audio files on the 'newly recorded' menu.
