Compared to Audacity, Filmora’s AI Vocal Remover tool is quick and easy to use. It will facilitate your video editing process by allowing you to remove vocals and use instrumentals on the go. For instance, this feature allows you to easily dub any video without having to cover up the current vocals. This means that your videos will be more entertaining and engaging while keeping great soundtracks. Match the energy in your videos with the quality of the instrumentals with just a few clicks.

## **Conclusion**

Removing vocals from a video song or audio file gives you more freedom in your projects. You can use the audio as an instrumental or in other creative ways. Audacity is among the most popular vocal removers on the internet. It offers several ways to remove vocals clearly from your audio tracks or music files. Vocal isolation audacity is easy and takes only a few steps. However, we recommend the AI vocal remover feature by Filmora because it is more versatile and accurate. The automated feature takes care of everything for you when removing the vocals from your audio files. You also get to utilize other useful video editing features that automate mundane tasks.
