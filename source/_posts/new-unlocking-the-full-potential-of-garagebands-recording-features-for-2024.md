"I've been using this app for years now. It's been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I'm not a super picky consumer, especially when I don't pay for the app!

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."

"I've been using the app for 4 years. I like it, but there are some annoying "features."

1) the screen won't time out when the app is active.

2) the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of "recent" (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.

Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.'

I've suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something "exclusive"), but I couldn't stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.

Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you're coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app."

"I've been using this app for years now. It's been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I'm not a super picky consumer, especially when I don't pay for the app!

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."

* **User Review of Tune In Podcast**

"I've been using the app for 4 years. I like it, but there are some annoying "features."

1) the screen won't time out when the app is active.

2) the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of "recent" (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.

Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.'

I've suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something "exclusive"), but I couldn't stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.

Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you're coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app."
