_With which tool can I add audio in an avi container? Because VDMod, Nandub and Avi-Mux is useless for this process..._

 Sometimes you may want to add audio to AVI but find many programs don't support this. So here I recommend a powerful video editing tool –[Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily add audio to AVI or other video formats such as MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file. Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video using the simple steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1 Add the files to the program

 Install and launch Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). Then import both the AVI file and audio track to this program. To do this, click the “Import” button or directly drag and drop them to the Media Item. Then select these added files and drop them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The video file should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the audio track.

![remove audio from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Adjust the audio file

 If the video and the soundtrack lengths do not match, you may need to edit the audio. For example, if the audio file is longer than your video, move the slider to the end of the audio, and drag it to fit the length of the video. If the video is longer than the music track, you can copy and paste the audio file and place the copied files side by side on the same track.

 If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in/out as you like.

 Note: if your AVI file already contains an audio track, you should remove it first. To do this, right click the AVI file and choose “Audio Detach” to separate the original audio from video. Then press “Delete” button on the keyboard to remove it.

![remove audio track from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/audio-detach.jpg)

#### 3 Save the new file

 After adding the audio and combining it with the video, you can export it as a new file. Click “Create ” and select “Format” tab. In the output window, select the required format. You can also go to the “Device” tab and export with the ready-made preset for your mobile device. Of course, you can also directly upload it to YouTube for sharing with the world or burn to DVD for playing on home TV.

You have a video that includes a great soundtrack that you'd like to **extract** it so that you can listen to it using the media player - a portable MP3 player, for instance. That can be a very easy job if you use the professional video editing software- [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Just follow this guide to **extract audio from video** with ease.

**_If you didn't have Filmora yet, click the download button below to get started._**

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Import video files

Install and run this Wondershare Filmora. Then click the “Import” button to locate and add your target video. You can also directly drag and drop the video to the program. The loaded video will be listed in the media library as the following picture shows.

![extract audio from video - import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/extract-audio-from-video-filmora9-media-library.jpg)

#### 2. Start extracting audio from video

![extract audio from video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-filmora9.jpg)

After importing video to Wondershare Filmora, drag the video from the media library to the video Timeline. You can then right-click the video clip and choose “Audio Detach” to extract audio from the video. After a while, video and audio will be displayed on different tracks. If you don’t want to keep the video file, right-click it and choose “Delete” to remove it from the video timeline.

#### 3. Edit the extracted audio if you like

Double click the extracted file in the audio track and then you will see the audio editing panel.

You can add fade-in and fade-out effects, [change the sound volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjust the pitch to [change the voice](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), etc. as you like.

![edit extracted audio from video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg)

If you find some unnecessary sounds in the extracted audio file, and you want to delete them, just put the cursor to the place where you would like the deletion to start and press the “Split” button to split. The end of the deletion area can be marked similarly – play the audio and select the final point of the area to be excluded from the output audio, and then press the “Split” button again.

![split and delete unwanted part from extracted audio ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-delete-extracted-audio-min.gif)

Select a desirable output method and then click the “Export” button to save the audio track.
