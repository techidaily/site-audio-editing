![sound forge vs audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sound-forge-vs-audacity.jpg)

### What is Audacity?

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is free and open-source software developed by Dominic Mazzoni and Roger Dannenberg and released on May 28, 2000\. In April 2021, Muse group acquired the Audacity trademark but kept the application free and open source.

Audacity offers a great variety of features, such as a playback/record tool, editing options, and a wide range of effects that help professionals to adjust soundtracks, import and export audio files in any standard format, and analyze sound frequencies.

### Our Recommendations

Due to the advanced features and high scores on G2, we recommend using Audacity. However, other factors always come into play as the audio editing demands and needs change with time. So, **Sound Forge** can be a good option for you as a nomad in the music editing industry.

Most companies (with 50-200 employees and 1M-10M revenue) and the higher education industry in the United States are using Sound Forge.

On the other hand, businesses often use Audacity for marketing purposes, such as making Podcasts. The software can record audio for PowerPoint presentations to help visually impaired employees.
