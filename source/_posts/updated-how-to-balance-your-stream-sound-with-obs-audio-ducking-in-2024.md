Video making or filmmaking has now come to the level where the history of imperfections faded away a long time ago. Yes, while the animation is still ruling the floor, an inevitable back-end process might look off-screen and a little complicated. One such job is **ducking sound** that is the process of balancing voiceover and the background audio. If you aren't a tech-savvy person, I hope to go in-depth isn't needed, and hence we stop here. To depict how you need to work out this **ducking music** process, we have this post.

If you are a content creator, maybe you will be familiar with coordinating the right audio with the video. If not, it isn't a problem anymore as I have included a detailed guide of implementing **audio ducking** in a step-wise way. With primary importance to the popular software **OBS** followed by a suitable alternative, let's begin our article!

## Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?

**OBS** (Open Broadcaster Software) is free and open-source software reliable for Windows, Linux, and macOS 10.13+. With countless features like real video/audio capture, mixer, custom transitions, easy-to-use configurations, pre-source filters, VST plug-in support, noise suppression, and a lot more, you can accomplish audio ducking in OBS by adding a sidechain/ducking compression filter. Thus, perform OBS audio ducking in a clean manner by lowering the audio automatically once OBS detects audio on the other audio source.

Does this magic of OBS audio ducking seem new to you? It will not be anymore as the below step-by-step manual will guide you through the process.

**Step 1: Add video files**

Launch the OBS software on your system, and import the files into the workspace with the "File" menu. If you need to add voiceover from your microphone, you can click the "Start Recording" option under the main interface's control section.

If the video plays on VLC in the background, it will appear on the mixer column.

**Step 2: Choose filter and compressor**

On the **Settings** icon next to the streaming video, click on it, and choose the “Filters” option from the drop-down.

You will reach the pop-up of the "Filters for Desktop Audio" whereby clicking on the "+" icon, choose the compressor option.

On the space bar, enter a name for the filter. For example, for **ducking music**, specify as "ducking," and press "OK."

**Step 3: Change the parameters**

You can now specify the values of the ratio, threshold, attack, release, output gain, and the ducking source, for example, “Mic” for microphone voiceover addition.

It's complete. Yes, OBS audio ducking is over. Now you can check the video and alter the parameters if required after a preview.
