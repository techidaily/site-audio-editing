 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Robots can’t be creative, right? A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it. So, let’s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.

| [1 - Amper Music](#1)  | [2 - AIVA](#2)         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [3 - Jukedeck](#3)     | [4 - Ecrett Music](#4) |
| [5 - Melodrive](#5)    | [6 - ORB Composer](#6) |

You can create music with Jukedeck for free if you decide to give all the rights to the AI composer, while both individuals and small businesses can purchase the license to use the song created with Jukedeck for just $0.99.

That’s why you need to know at least the basic rules of music composition in order to be able to use the ORB Composer properly. The AI music composer comes bundled with a rich collection of chord progressions, that contains almost all chords used in popular music. This tool is aimed at artists who are interested in experimenting with the possibilities of creating music with artificial intelligence and discovering new styles of music.
