02 [5 Recommended Best Sound Editor in 2024](#part2)

## Part 1\. What Should Be Considered Before Choose a Sound Editor?

There are various sound editors available. We are here to help you by sharing different factors that should be considered to select a better sound editing app. Let’s start!

### 1\. Recording Options and Supported Channels

What kind of recording options are needed? If you can record from external devices, nothing is better than that. Moving on, the number of supported channels also matters a lot. This is because not every Podcast will take three or four tracks.

### 2\. Plugins and Add On

While selecting your sound editing app, check its behavior with other apps. This is because editing software expands with additional features, sounds, and other plugins and add-ons. Some of these are free, whereas some are costly.

### 3\. Operating System and Pricing

One important thing that should be checked is your device’s compatibility with the sound editor. What so ever device and operating system you use, make sure it works with your device. Lastly, remember one thing, editing like professionals do not require tons of money. It's essential that you wisely select an affordable editor.

### 4\. Editing Features

A sound editor should contain a mixture of basic and advanced editing features across its platform. It should include features such as the ones provided as follows:

* Audio Tracks: A good sound editor should at least support playing three audio tracks simultaneously in addition to the sound of the main audio track.
* Volume Control: Apart from this, an ideal sound editing software should also enable volume control for different parts of the video project.
* Normalization: Among the different features, one very noticeable feature that sound editing apps must have is Normalization. The feature automatically adjusts all the different volume levels of various sounds into balance.
* Auto Music: Auto music is the next editing feature we are going to share. This feature helps to make the length of the stock library audio according to your project length.
* Noise Filter: What do you think about noise filters? They are essential as in case of any recording that has background noise; these filters can do the magic.

### 5\. Export Audio

The audio editor should provide you with the option of changing the file format of the audio to any other supported audio format. The variety should be wide, which provides users with different opportunities to work across while exporting the audio.

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.

## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.
