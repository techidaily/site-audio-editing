However, it's worth noting that there are now just a few possibilities for the latter.

In addition, Audacity for Chromebook has low system requirements, to the point where it works even if your PC is able to power on. Using this editing program, you may mix and match multiple audio formats and sample rates to create a single, cohesive piece of work. In addition, when it comes to editing, you'll enjoy the unparalleled ease of cutting, copying, and pasting, trimming to the sample level, duplicating, and even adding bespoke fades with the discretely introduced envelope tool.

Audacity seems to have all of the essential impacts. Whether you're looking for preset EQ curves like those found on a telephone or an AM radio, or Bass and Treble improvements, this versatile program has you covered. With the Auto-Duck tool, you may add a voiceover and other essential features to a podcast, such as a compressor, limiter reverb, and phaser reverb. It's an excellent choice if you don't have a lot of extra requirements. Even if you don't use it often, Audacity will be the last piece of editing software you ever buy.

## Installing Audacity for Chromebook

Apps for Chromebooks are often downloaded through the Google Play Store approach. However, sinceAudacity for Chromebook does not support our low-power systems, we must go the other route. To put it another way, you'll have to use Linux to get Audacity.

Linux is pre-installed on most Chromebooks, however, it is still in Beta. Go to the Settings menu and choose Enable from the drop-down menu to use this feature. Please go here for further information on how to enable Linux on your Chromebook. If your device has this wonderful function, you may follow the instructions below to properly install Audacity for Chromebook.

* Open the Linux Terminal in the Launcher.

* If you've done everything correctly up to this point, you'll be able to enjoy the full benefits of the Linux operating system. What follows instead is a bewildering cacophony of bluster.

While recording your podcast using the built-in microphone on your Chromebook is a great way to start, it's not the only way to fine-tune the final product. You must drag the track and sound to the center of the screen in order to begin the magic with this program. Once you've done this, you'll be offered a variety of alternatives to get the editing process started.

Using Audacity for multitrack recording & editing is doable, but it's best to use non-linear tools if primary focus is on that element. Apart from that, Audacity is widely regarded as one of the best audio editors on the market.

## Conclusion

Your Chromebook may be able to run a variety of audio recording applications. As with Audacity, you won't be limited in your ability to produce high-quality music with a wide range of unique effects. We also go through Filmora's voice effects & how users may use them to change and improve their voices. Filmora allows you to re-voice video/audio & previously recorded voiceovers. For video/audio & voiceover files, the Pitch option on the Timeline may be used. Change the tone of a video and recording to make it sound different.
