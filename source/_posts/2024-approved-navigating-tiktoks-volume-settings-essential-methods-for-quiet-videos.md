### News Intro

The intro to your news channel or program must be engaging and attractive. It should be 3 to 5 seconds long and should cover the important details of the show.

### Background of the News

Moving on, the next important thing to consider is the reporter's background. Most expert and established news broadcaster channels use chroma key to create the magic. In this way, the background color can be changed easily and flawlessly. Most news anchors prefer green background.

### News Production

The preparation of shooting the news should be ahead of time. The reporter's position has to be planned to keep in view the placement of the scenario reporter. Similarly, you can give an impression of the expert talking by using the friend's street. The picture-in-picture feature can be used to do the trick.

### Logo's Channel

The logo of your news channel should be included in the video to convey the brand's professionalism and credibility. It can be placed in the corner effortlessly.

### Wrapping Up
