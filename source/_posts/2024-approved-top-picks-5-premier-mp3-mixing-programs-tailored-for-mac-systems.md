* Go to **file**\> **Export**
* Select your preferred option from the submenu to export the modified audio as needed

**Note:** Changing the tempo usually doesn't change the pitch of the audio up to some extent. However, you can expect some variations in the pitch if the new tempo value is too high or too low.

### Conclusion

You may want to **slow down or speed up audio** if the existing one is not up to the mark, and you wish to manage the ambiance with the help of the music track either while playing a video or when merely a soundtrack is to be played during some event. In either case, the best tool for all your needs is Wondershare Filmora, and if you are looking for a program dedicated to audio only, Audacity is something worth trying.
