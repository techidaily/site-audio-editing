## **Part 1\. Audio Hiss: What is it and Why Remove it**

A hiss is a broadband noise across the audible spectrum of your audio. It becomes more intense in high frequencies, affecting the quality of the vocals and instrumentals in your audio. A hiss could sound like blue noise and is often caused by the electronic components themselves, which is referred to as self or inherent noise.

![hiss in audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-reverb-from-audio-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG)

A hiss is measured by decibels and is usually difficult to avoid because it is produced by electronic components. You will usually hear the hiss as air that is getting out of a narrow passage. You may also hear a reverb, which is a sound that occurs in space and sends sound waves out in all directions. Since this is a component of the original recording, it is impossible to delete it. However, hiss reduction is possible with the right editing software.

### **Causes of Hiss in Audio Recordings**

* Electronic components such as microphones, video cameras, and interfaces create self-noise because of the heat energy created by the moving parts
* Audio circuits generate self-noise, with the noise floor being the level of the inherent noise in the circuit
* Screening and quality of electronic components, which cheap and poorly made equipment producing more hiss
* Poor-quality audio cables contribute to hiss and hum when they are picked up during recording

### **Importance of Removing Hiss for a Professional Sound**

Removing hiss from audio is important for a professional sound because it makes the sound clearer and polished. The polished sound leads to

* Improved clarity and focus on the main vocals or instruments in a recording sound
* A more professional and smooth sound
* Increases listener engagement
* More understandable vocals and more vibrant instrumentals

## **Part 4\. Tips and Tricks to Avoid Hiss and Reverb Noise**

The problem of hissing sound and reverb noise usually comes from the equipment itself. However, some background noise may add to the problem. Making a few adjustments to the recording stage may help in reducing hiss and background noise:

* **Optimize the Recording Space**

The noise-producing items in your recording space may add to the hissing noise in your audio. While most of the noise may seem innocent, they may amplify themselves when listening to the recorded footage. Optimizing your space before you start, such as closing the windows and doors or turning off your electronic devices will help to reduce the noise.

* **Reduce Subject-to-Microphone Distance**

Keeping the microphone as close as possible to the subject will drastically improve the speech-to-noise ratio. The microphone will record more of the subject’s voice than the background noise, giving you a clearer audio output.

* **Use a Microphone with Gain-Boost**

An enhanced gain microphone preamp helps to reduce hiss and notice from the audio in an incredible way. Specifically, the camera’s preamplifier does not add gain because the volume setting is kept low.

* **Use Directional Microphones**

Usually, microphones signal outside their axis. This is often the case for cardioid polar and short gun patterns. This quality is great for reducing noise when you use directional microphones. The microphone will only focus on what you are interested in, ignoring the background noise.

* **Turn Off Camera’s Auto-Gain**

The AGC or Auto Gain Control feature is popular in modern cameras. It automatically adjusts the gain for low- and high-volume sounds to make them even. However, it can enhance everything for a quiet setting, causing hissing background noise. Turning the feature off gives you more control over what sounds to focus on.

* **Reduce the Number of Open Microphones**

Open microphones will continue recording audio even when you are not interested in that sound. Keeping this number low will help reduce hissing sound by focusing only on what you are recording.

## **Conclusion**

Hiss and reverb background noise is an annoying problem. The unwanted sounds affect the quality of your audio and the level of engagement in your footage. While eliminating causes of hiss when recording is the best way to reduce it, sometimes you may notice when it is too late. Using the right editing software will help you reduce the noise and improve the quality of your audio. Wondershare Filmora allows you to do this with the AI Audio Denoise feature. The AI-powered feature will automatically reduce hiss noise and reverb in your clips, giving you clearer and more engaging audio.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

If you are a content creator, you might already know the importance of having the right audio component in a video. For attaining a perfect balance between voiceovers and the background audio, the concept of "ducking" is implemented. I have come up with this post to help you know more about **audio ducking** and its importance. I will also include a detailed guide for [implementing audio ducking on a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in a stepwise manner. Let’s begin!

![What is Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-audio-ducking.jpg)

* [Part 1: What Is Audio Ducking?](#part1)
* [Part 2: When to Use Audio Ducking?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Use the Audio Ducking Feature in Filmora?](#part3)

## Audio Ducking: What Is It All About?

In nutshell, it is a process that “ducks” or lowers the background volume when a voiceover appears. For instance, let’s consider that we already have a background score in our video playing. When we would add a narrator’s voice or apply a voiceover, it would create a lot of confusion. Therefore, we implement the audio ducking process to lower the background audio and amplify the voiceover instead.

In most cases, it is achieved through a side-chain compression technique. A control channel is set up that enables the compression of one sound (the background) while amplifying another (the voiceover).

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## When Do You Need to Implement Audio Ducking?

Since the concept of audio ducking is pretty useful, it can be implemented in different ways during the video editing process. While you can apply the process to any video, here are some of the major instances where it is used.

#### Travel Vlogs

If you are a travel vlogger, you might already know how tough it can be to make yourself heard in a video. When there are too many background noises, your voice can be diminished. This is exactly where you can apply audio ducking to [decrease the background noise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and focus on your voice.

#### Make-up Tutorials

While creating make-up video tutorials, most of us use a background track to keep our viewers engaged. At the same time, you need to let them know about the process by speaking clearly. If you use audio ducking, then you can easily attain a perfect balance between both sounds.

#### Other Instances

Ideally, if you are creating any other tutorial video for your audience, then audio ducking can be useful. From making video game tutorials to coming up with video lectures on a crucial topic, the concept would come in handy time and time again.

## How to Use the Audio Ducking Feature in Filmora?

To implement audio ducking in your videos, you can use a reliable editing tool like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### Step 2\.  Import An Audio or Record Voiceovers

Let's suppose that your video already has an audio track in the background, and now you wish to add another audio component. Most of the people would like to record their voices in the video. For this, you can click on the voiceover (mic) icon at the bottom of the preview panel. This will open a dedicated window so that you can start recording your voice for the video.

![Record Voiceover for Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-voiceovers-audio-ducking.jpg)

Apart from that, you can also go to the "Import" feature to add any other audio component to the project. Besides that, Wondershare Filmora also has a wide range of royalty-free audio files that you can easily add to your projects.

![Royalty-free Audio files for Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/royalty-free-audio-files.jpg)

#### Step 3\.  Apply Audio Ducking to Your Video

After adding the second audio component, you can view it under the video timeline on Filmora. Now, you need to select the audio track you wish to amplify (like your voiceover) and not the track that already has a prominent volume.

![Apply Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-audio-ducking.jpg)

Once you have selected the audio you wish to amplify, right-click to get its context menu. Just select the “Adjust Audio” feature from all the available options.

![Adjust Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/right-click-adjust-audio.jpg)

This will launch a dedicated window on the screen with various audio options to apply. Go to the "Ducking" option here and enable the "Lower the volume of other clips" feature. You can also use a slider here to adjust how much you wish to lower the volume of other clips in the project.

![Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/audio-ducking-lower-other-clips.png)

That’s it! Once you have selected the value, click on the "OK" button. You can now preview the results on Filmora and check that the volume of other audio components has been ducked. You can later go to the “Export” option and save the project in the format of your choice.

![Preview Audio Ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-audio-ducking.jpg)

It’s all fun when recording and posing for great videos, not until you realize that the quality of the sound is far below your expectations, the joy derived fades off and you seek ways in which to perfect the quality of sound. Whenever you rely on the microphone of your camera, the sound recorded may be similar to that of someone mumbling in a cave. When the sound is of importance to you just like the images are, it is worth investing in an experienced audio producer to help the muffled sounds be much cleaner and clear. Generally, the biggest reason as to why one would want to improve the audio quality is to give presentable videos with clear audios and benefit from them.
