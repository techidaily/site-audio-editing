## The Ultimate Selection: 5 Premium Audio/Video Integration Tools

When it comes to video or music production, a lot of work is involved in mixing sound. To facilitate an impressive result, you need a top-quality audio video mixer. This would allow you effectively combine audio files and videos. You also need the mixer to allow you to touch up elements like the sound quality and speed and eliminate background disturbance.

For most music producers, and efficient audio video mixer is crucial. They also need the mixer to be easy to use and efficient enough to offer excellent results. In this article, we’ll explore the five best audio video mixers we could find. Explore this review and choose the mixer that best suits your needs.

Best Audio Video Mixers to Consider

Below, we’ll carefully review the best mixers to take your audio and video files to the next level. So keep reading to find the best fit for you.

1. [How to Mix Audio Video Tracks with Wondershare Filmora](#part6-1)

## [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

![adobe audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-video-mixer-1.jpg)

**Compatibility:**Mac and Windows

This is a next-level audio video mixer that we find to be an excellent option for mixing, recording, editing, and restoring files. This mixing software allows you easily record music or podcast for various platforms. In addition, it offers a sharing feature that will enable you to share directly from the platform. Adobe Audition provides two mixing modes: the waveform view and the multitrack view. While the Waveform view is ideal for stereo editing, the multitrack view allows users to edit tracks on a timeline. Luckily Audition enables you to switch between both views whenever you want, so you don’t have to choose one.

One of the impressive features that make Adobe Audition one of the best audio video mixers in 2022 is the ability to remove silence from inactive parts in the audio file. While doing this, you don’t have to lose sync in the file. As a result, it is ideal for podcasts and interview audios. It also features a loudness radar that allows you to analyze submix, single tracks, full mix, and many more according to several broadcast requirements.

Another nice feature we found impressive with Audition is the DeReverb tool that allows you to eliminate or remove reverberations from the audio file. IT efficiently handles short delays and spacious reverbs in your video and audio files. The sound remover tool is another impressive tool that allows you to remove car alarms, errant bumps, paper shuffling, and other unnecessary sounds from your audio and video file.
