## Mastering Top Mac MP3 Labeling Software: A Comprehensive Guide

Some people love to collect and organize songs, and they are addicted to creating music libraries. Are you one of them? If you are, you must know how things are organized, but if you have never organized a music library, let's tell you how it's done. ID3 tags are used to store information. You can use the tags and store the artist's name, song name, genre, and whatever you want.

You might organize music according to artist or dates; however, you like it. The problem arises when you don't have correct information stored in the tags. For this reason, Mac MP3 tag editors are used. If you are a Mac user, who wants to edit tags, let's provide you with a list of the best Mac music tag editors. Let’s get started!

#### In this article

01 [What Need to Be Considered Before Choosing a Mac MP3 Tag Editor?](#part1)

02 [5 Recommended Mac MP3 Tag Editor](#part2)

## Part 1\. What Need to Be Considered Before Choosing a Mac MP3 Tag Editor

Have you ever looked at the internet and the number of options you get whenever you search for MP3 tag editor Mac free? The page is all packed and loaded with tons of different options. No doubt it's tough to select a good tag editor, but what if we tell you some tricks for selecting a great Mac music tag editor? Without any further delay, let’s begin.

### · Easy to User Interface

A primary factor that is considered while selecting any tool, the editor, is its interface. If any software offers a complex interface, users don't prefer it. An easy interface means all the editing, manipulating, adding, deleting options appear on the front. Users don't have to struggle to find basic options.

### · Online Database Search

If any macOS MP3 tag editor offers an online database search means it’s a good editor. This is because not all editors support online search. The option is very helpful as the online search shares all the information related to any searched tag.

### · Editing Options

How many editing options do you prefer? Editing metadata means that you should be able to edit and manipulate as many fields as possible. For instance, the Mac music tag editor should allow changing the singer's name, year tag, and all the other fields.

### · Batch Processing

Editing is a stressful and hectic job. Is there a way to help yourself? Let’s share about Batch Processing. If the Mac MP3 tag editor allows batch processing, then it's a great choice. This is because editing individually can take hours, but batch processing reduces the editing time as well as the editing efforts.

### · Supported Formats

It uses all the things that you would normally see in a backwards video and it really is a great video as well. You will also find that the backwards technique adds a complete new dynamic to the video as well so it really is interesting to watch. On top of this, the song is great and the whole scene works really well so you can already start to see how the backwards technique is becoming more and more prominent in today's industry.

### [2\. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01TL9bUWr6I)

 Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse. On top of this, it also shows the guys jump onto the pillows and the entire scene is reversed. The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.

### [3\. Tongue Tied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x1wjGKHjBI)

 This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.

### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

 This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.

### [5\. Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt50B772Fcg)

 This video was done by a group called Small Feet and it really does have a lot to offer, from start to finish. Even though this video made it to number 5 on the list, doesn't mean that it isn't interesting. It was directed by Oskar Wrango and it uses nature in an attempt to tell the story of the song. This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.

 So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn't mean that they are any less interesting to watch. Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don't you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You'd be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.

Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don't you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You'd be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.

 Video reverse is undoubtedly a fantastic way to demonstrate a scene in an interesting way. Filmed normally and then played backwards, this kind of videos can sometimes produce some amazing visual effects. If you want to know some pretty good videos that are played with video reversal, or backwards as some may call it, and learn from their creativeness so as to create one of your own, then you have certainly come to the right place. The following 5 videos top our list of the best backwards music videos.

## 5 of the Best Backwards music videos

### [1\. Forward by Messe Kopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6jprOZ29wY)

 This video was created by Messe Kopp and it is a perfect example of how backwards video techniques have evolved over recent years. It uses all the things that you would normally see in a backwards video and it really is a great video as well. You will also find that the backwards technique adds a complete new dynamic to the video as well so it really is interesting to watch. On top of this, the song is great and the whole scene works really well so you can already start to see how the backwards technique is becoming more and more prominent in today's industry.

### [2\. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01TL9bUWr6I)

 Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse. On top of this, it also shows the guys jump onto the pillows and the entire scene is reversed. The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.

### [3\. Tongue Tied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x1wjGKHjBI)

 This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.

### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

 This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.

### [5\. Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt50B772Fcg)

 This video was done by a group called Small Feet and it really does have a lot to offer, from start to finish. Even though this video made it to number 5 on the list, doesn't mean that it isn't interesting. It was directed by Oskar Wrango and it uses nature in an attempt to tell the story of the song. This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.

 So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn't mean that they are any less interesting to watch.
