Volume boosters are safe, especially for the **sound booster** apps mentioned above. These apps use advanced technology to boost the loudness of your smartphone by sacrificing clarity without damaging your phone. However, using these booster apps for short periods of time is recommended since they are built with limits for boosting volume.
