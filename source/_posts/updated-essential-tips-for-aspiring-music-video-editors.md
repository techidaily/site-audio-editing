Even though it is quite straightforward to insert video and audio files in this app for combining them, you can go through the following instructions if you are confused:

● Inside the Mast Music Video Status Maker app, you can find the Add button to import all of your video files.

● Once that is done, go to the Music icon tab, where you can find a wide range of popular music tracks.

● If you want, you can also import music files from your smartphone.

● After that, add the music file under your video file and adjust its position.

● At last, save the video on your phone to share it on any social media platform of your choice.

### Conclusion

You can find video files on all kinds of online social media platforms. These are great for both entertainment and for learning new things online. Moreover, sharing videos with your friends can also be a great way to connect with them. Although, to ensure that you are sharing high-quality videos, you must use a music adder to video tool. Even a high-quality video won’t look the same without the right music.
