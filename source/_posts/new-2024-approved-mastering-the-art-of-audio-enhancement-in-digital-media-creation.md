 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

There are times when you encounter an audio file in AIFF format. It is an uncompressed file format, which means that the file size is often large.

That’s why you need to find the best AIFF to MP3 converter.

## How to Convert AIFF to MP3

There are various ways to convert your AIFF files to MP3\. It depends on your preferences. You can choose from the different solutions available for you, which include free online conversion services, free desktop software programs, and all-purpose audio editors and converters that support converting AIFF to MP3 files.

## #1. Free Online Conversion Services

When looking for the best AIFF to MP3 Converter, one of the top choices is a free online conversion service.

All you need to do is to upload the audio file to the website, and it will be converted into MP3\. Then you will be given a link where you can download the converted file.

## #2. Free Desktop Software Program

Another solution that allows you to convert AIFF to MP3 files is a free desktop software program.

While free desktop software programs do their job, most of them are dedicated to converting AIFF to MP3 and nothing more. Once you are done with the task, they will only occupy space in your hard drive until you need to convert another audio file once again. The good news is that it is free to use.

## #3. All-Purpose Audio Editor and Converter
