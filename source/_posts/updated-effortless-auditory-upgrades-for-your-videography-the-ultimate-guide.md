## 10 Leading Alternatives for Interacting and Networking in Cyberspace

# Top 10 Best Websites Like Omegle

![author avatar](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg)

One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

#### **2\.** [**ChatRandom**](https://chatrandom.com/)

![chatrandom-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrandom-poster1.jpg)

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.
      * Members are matched by their unique code.
      * On the site, you can video chat with others.
      * You can easily use the site's features.

#### **3\.** [**YouNow**](https://www.younow.com/)

![younow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png)

Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow's goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

#### **2\.** [**ChatRandom**](https://chatrandom.com/)

![chatrandom-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrandom-poster1.jpg)

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.
      * Members are matched by their unique code.
      * On the site, you can video chat with others.
      * You can easily use the site's features.

#### **3\.** [**YouNow**](https://www.younow.com/)

![younow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png)

Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow's goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

      * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.
      * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.
      * Allows you to start a broadcast.
      * You can join the broadcast of other streams also to interact with them.
      * You can also make friends and send and receive gifts from them

* Install Audacity via PPA
* Install Audacity via Snap Store

First, we'll use the PPA approach to install Audacity.

### Install Audacity via PPA

Installing Audacity on an Ubuntu system is as simple as entering the following line in the terminal to include the unofficial PPA developed by "ubuntuhandbook" to the Ubuntu system's software sources, then rebooting.

![install-audacity-snap-store-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-snap-store-step1.png)

You will be prompted to hit the Enter key to proceed with the process of adding your Audacity package to your sources list. To begin the process of introducing PPA to the sources list, press the Enter key.

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step2.png)

After you've added the Audacity package to the system's software sources, you'll need to update the package repository in order to get Audacity to work.

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step3.png)

As soon as you have updated the package repository, you should be able to successfully install Audacity.

Navigate to Activities & type in the word 'audacity' to find it.

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step4.png)

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step5.png)

### Installing Audacity from the Snap Store

A version of Audacity is also available for download via the Snap shop. Using a Snap is among the quickest and most straightforward methods of installing any program since it takes into account all of the application's updates and dependencies. In order to install Audacity using Snap, you must first ensure that Snap is already installed on the Ubuntu system. Snap is pre-installed in the newest versions of Ubuntu and is available as a default. If Snap is not already installed on your system, you may do it by using the instructions shown below.

![install-audacity-snap-store-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-snap-store-step1.png)

![install-audacity-snap-store-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-snap-store-step2.png)

After safely installing Snap, you'll be able to proceed to install Audacity by using the script provided in the next section.

![install-audacity-snap-store-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-snap-store-step3.png)

It will just take a few minutes to download & install Audacity on your computer.

![install-audacity-snap-store-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-snap-store-step4.png)

As soon as Audacity has been installed via the Snap method, launch the program by searching for the phrase 'audacity' in the Application menu.

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step4.png)

To launch Audacity, click on the Audacity icon on your desktop.

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step5.png)

## How to uninstall Audacity Ubuntu

For whatever reason, if you wish to remove the Audacity program from your computer, you may follow these instructions.

### Method 1

If you installed Audacity through the Snap method, execute the following command in your terminal: **$ sudo snap remove Audacity**

### Method 2

If you have installed the application using the PPA, you may remove it by performing the instructions shown below.

\>**Step** 1:

The first step is to

This indicates that the add-apt-repository command was used to add the PPA to your system. You may also use the same command to uninstall the PPA from your computer. Simply include the —remove option in your command.

**$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**

\>**Step** 2:

As of the right moment, the PPA has been withdrawn. What happens to the programs that are installed using these PPAs? Will they be eliminated as a consequence of the abolition of the Patriot Act? The answer is a resounding no.

Thus, PPA-purge enters the scene to help solve the problem. The PPA is disabled, but all of the apps installed by the PPA are also uninstalled, or they are reverted to the original versions given by your distribution.

Install the PPA-purge package and remove the Audacity package may be accomplished by running the following command.

**$ sudo apt install ppa-purge && sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**
