## "Windows Users: Top 10 Essential Audio Leveling Tools "

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows
