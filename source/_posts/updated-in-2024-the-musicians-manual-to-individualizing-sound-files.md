**Step 4:** Tap on “start encode” which will convert the audio in MP4 format. Now the audio extraction from the video is done using VLC player.

**Step 5:** Open the VLC player and select the “convert” option inside “media”.

**Step 6:** Tap on “add” in the Open Media pane then select the recently created handbrake video. From the drop-down next to the Convert/Save option, tap on “convert”.

**Step 7:** Below profile, tap on “MP3” on the following screen, name the file and enter the directory then select “start” and voila! You are done.

## How to Extract Audio from Streaming Video?

You can use [Video Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-downloader-professi/elicpjhcidhpjomhibiffojpinpmmpil?hl=en) if you use Chrome as a web browser or [DownloadHelper](http://www.downloadhelper.net/) for Firefox users in order to download any streaming video as a file locally in your system. If one asks how to extract audio from the mp4 video, the process remains the same.

After the downloading process, there exist several programs for audio extraction from a video.

Below are the steps for the [VLC player](https://www.videolan.org/index.html):

**Step 1:** Open VLC player, select “media” then click “convert/save” option, click “Add” beside File Selection box.

**Step 2:** Browse the desired downloaded file from PC and press “OK”.

**Step 3:** Select “audio-MP3” from “profile” and then select “start”.

## Conclusion

Depending upon the availability of resources, all of the aforementioned approaches are great in their own way.

But considering that Wondershare filmora runs smoothly given the easiest interface and requiring least steps to perform audio extraction whilst being compatible with Mac and Windows both operating system, I would personally recommend this software for ease of accessibility and usability.

Hence, it seems like you can't have everything in one software. Even the best, free DAW software lack a feature or two.

## How to Choose a DAW Software

Often, choosing the DAW software best suited to your needs can be confusing. However, a few simple questions will help you narrow down your list. Are recording instrumentals or live singing? Do you wish to use samples, in-built sounds, and loops? Are you low on budget?

Although DAW software can cost a fortune, many of these software's are accessible free with a few limitations. For instance, Studio One Prime V4, despite being free, does not support VST plug-ins. Similarly, Roland Zenbeats also requires money to be able to access additional features and VST plug-ins. One of the most favorite DAW software, namely Cakewalk by Bandlab, offers exceptional features complete with VST plug-in support but is limited to use on Windows only.

Hence, it seems like you can't have everything in one software. Even the best, free DAW software lack a feature or two. But despite lacking a few high-end features, the free DAW software's are productive enough, owing to the rapid technological advancements, to render your audios flawless and professional sounding.

## Conclusion

Irrespective of the fact that the above set of free DAW software is pretty easy than the others, each one of them requires some time to get accustomed. If you ever get stuck while handling the above best DAW for beginners, always remember to refer to the online learning videos that come handy to serve you better.

Once you get the hang of the software, you can easily manage it with ease.
