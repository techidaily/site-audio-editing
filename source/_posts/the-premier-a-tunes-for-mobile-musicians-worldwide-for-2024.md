### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

##### Step 1 Download and install the YTD Video downloader

Now using your browser, navigate to the YouTube video with the sound effect you wish to save.

### 2\. Make Angry Dog Effect by Yourself

This is one quick way to make a sound effect, even though it will not give you the best quality sound. All you need is a smartphone and your dog. Here is the way to go about it –

##### Step 1 Take your dog to a room where no other sounds are made

##### Step 2 Then, chain the dog at one corner to minimize its movement

##### Step 3 Position your phone somewhere; it will pick the dog bark

Then hit record on the phone and move to a corner holding something that the dog will want or likes.
