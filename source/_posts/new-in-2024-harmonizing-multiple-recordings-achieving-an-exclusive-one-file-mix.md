**Note:** Changing the tempo usually doesn't change the pitch of the audio up to some extent. However, you can expect some variations in the pitch if the new tempo value is too high or too low.

### Conclusion

You may want to **slow down or speed up audio** if the existing one is not up to the mark, and you wish to manage the ambiance with the help of the music track either while playing a video or when merely a soundtrack is to be played during some event. In either case, the best tool for all your needs is Wondershare Filmora, and if you are looking for a program dedicated to audio only, Audacity is something worth trying.

You can follow the steps given below to learn how to **change audio speed** with Wondershare Filmora:

### Step 1: Import Audio and Add to Filmora Timeline

Launch Filmora on your Windows or Mac computer, make sure that the **Media** icon is selected from the standard toolbar at the top, click the **+** icon in the **Media** (also referred to as **Library** here) window (on Mac) or anywhere in the **Media** window itself (on Windows) from the upper-left corner of the interface, and import the audio file that you want to manage the playback speed of. Next, drag the media file from the **Library** to the timeline.

### Step 2: Increase or Decrease Audio Speed

Ensure that the audio track is selected in the timeline. Click the **Speedometer** icon from the timeline toolbar at the upper section, hover mouse to the **Slow** option from the menu, and click your preferred value form the submenu to reduce the sound speed. Likewise, hover the mouse to the **Fast** option, and choose a value from the submenu to increase it.

![adjust audio speed in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-audio-with-custom-speed.jpg)

**Note:** Usually, the audio pitch wouldn't change as long as you pick the values anywhere between 0.5x and 5x. However, if you select any option beyond this range, you may experience variations in the pitch according the value you selected.

### Step 3: Set Custom Speed or Reverse the Audio

Click the **Speedometer** icon from above the timeline, and click **Custom Speed** from the menu. Use the slider to slow down (move to the left) or speed up (move to the right) the audio on the Custom Speed box. Alternatively, you can manually enter your preferred value in the available field for granular control. In addition, you can also check the **Reverse Speed** box to reverse the audio if need be.

### Step 4: Export the Output

Click **EXPORT** from the top-center area of the interface, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** box that opens next, select your preferred audio format from the **Format** list in the left, make necessary customizations from the right pane, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner of the box to export the audio with the modified speed.

## How to Change the Speed of Audio with Video in Filmora

The process to **change audio speed** that also has a video is identical to what is explained in the previous section. The only additional step required in this case is separating the audio track from that of video.

You can learn how to get this done by following the instructions given below:

### Step 1: Import File to Media Window and then Add to Timeline

Use the method explained in **Step 1** of the previous section to import a file to Filmora, drag the media to the timeline, and click **MATCH TO MEDIA** when the **Project Setting** box appears and prompts for confirmation. **Note:** Except for the **Project Setting** box, the rest of the process for adding audio and video files to the timeline is the same.

### Step 2: Separate Audio from Video

Select and then right-click the video track with audio in the timeline, and click **Detach Audio** from the context menu.

![detach audio from video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-filmora9.jpg)

### Step 3: Adjust the Audio Speed

After the audio is detached, you can select the audio track and follow the method explained in the previous section to adjust its speed as needed. As for the video, you can use the trimming and cropping options to adjust its duration and size and export the entire project as explained in **Step 4** of the previous section. **Note:** To export the project as video, all you need to do is, choose a video format like MP4 or something similar to that when on the **Export** box.
