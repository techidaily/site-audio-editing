The concept of audio ducking is simple. In a soundtrack, you can find a wide range of music playing in the background.

The scenario happens vice versa when the speaker completes its conversation. Here, the background music increases, and the speaker's audio is reduced drastically. This type of audio ducking occurs to enhance the audio quality and reach the target audience without any issues.
