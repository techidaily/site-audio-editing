## Part 4\. How to Add Audio to iMovie from Spotify?

Offline playback is possible with a Spotify Premium membership. You may save songs, playlists, or albums to listen to later. The essential element to remember is that Spotify music, whether online or offline, can only be accessed through the Spotify application. To put it another way, you do not have permission to import Spotify music into other third-party software programs. It comes with iMovie and other video editing software.

**Step #1\.** Import music from Spotify into **AudFree**. The AudFree Spotify converter must be compatible with the Spotify app. When you run AudFree program from your computer's desktop, Spotify will immediately load. You may now begin to uncover preferred Spotify tunes to add to iMovie. Import them into AudFree by copying and pasting or dragging and dropping.

**Step #2\.** Set the output format and other preferences for iMovie. MP3, WAV, M4A, and AIFF are all supported by iMovie. You may go to the top menu and select 'Preferences' > 'Convert'. A setting window will appear. You may select one of the iMovie-supported audio formats as the output format in the window. You can also change the output parameters.

**Step #3\.** Spotify tracks may be converted for use in iMovie. To begin the download, click the 'Convert' button in the bottom-right corner of the main screen. AudFree program will download Spotify music to target iMovie files at up to 5X quicker speeds. You should disable your antivirus or firewall to make the converting process more stable.

● After you have added music of your choice using your preferred method, you can double click on the audio track to adjust its volume, pitch, keyframes, and many other advanced settings.

Just as you can probably guess by its name, iMovie is a video editor made by Apple which is available on almost all of its devices. This means that you can have a similar editing experience on your iPhone, iPad, iMac, and more. While this software is not ideal for any kind of advanced and large scale video editing projects, it is certainly more than enough for adding music to video files. Despite lacking video effects or other advanced features, you do get basic options like trimming, cutting, cropping, adding music, adding text, and other basic yet important features. Hence, if you want to learn how can I put music over a video on any of your Apple devices for completely free, then you can go through these steps and instructions:

● Since iMovie is available for both mobile devices and computers, we will be first taking a look at adding music on mobile devices and then on computers.

● On your Apple mobile device, you need to press the Add Media button on the iMovie timeline where you need to select Audio and browse from the display list.

● You can then tap on the Add icon next to the music track that you want to add to your videos.

● Finally, move the music track under your video and trip it to your desired length before saving your video in a desired video format along with the music track under it.

### #3) Put Music under video with Premiere Pro

Whether it is advanced video effects, plugins support, automated editing, extensive media support, color grading options, VFX support, compatibility with other Adobe tools, sound design, or anything else, Adobe Premiere Pro offers it all. As a result, if you want to use Premiere Pro for adding music to video files, then it can be done quite easily as described here:
