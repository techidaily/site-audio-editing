## Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?

Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.

On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.

## Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?

## How To Keep Safe While Talking to Strangers?

**1、Protect Your Personal Information:** Avoid sharing personal details such as your real name, address, phone number, or any financial information. Be cautious about revealing too much about your daily routine or family members.

**2、Stay Anonymous:** Use platforms that allow you to chat without disclosing your identity. Choose a username that doesn't give away personal details and be wary of sharing photos or videos that could be used to identify you.

**3、Use Secure and Reputable Platforms:** Choose chat platforms that are well-known for their safety features and community guidelines. Look for sites that offer moderation and the ability to report and block users who behave inappropriately.

**4、Trust Your Instincts:** If you feel uncomfortable or suspect that something isn't right about the person you're chatting with, trust your instincts. It's better to end the conversation than to put yourself at risk.

**5、Be Careful with Meeting in Person:** If you decide to meet someone you've met online, choose a public place and inform a friend or family member of your plans. Never agree to meet in a secluded or private location.

**6、Keep Conversations within the Platform:** Avoid moving conversations to other messaging apps or platforms where you might have less control and fewer safety features.

**7、Use Privacy Settings:** Take advantage of any privacy settings offered by the platform. Adjust settings to control who can see your profile or contact you.

## How To Keep Safe While Talking to Strangers?

**2、Stay Anonymous:** Use platforms that allow you to chat without disclosing your identity. Choose a username that doesn't give away personal details and be wary of sharing photos or videos that could be used to identify you.

**3、Use Secure and Reputable Platforms:** Choose chat platforms that are well-known for their safety features and community guidelines. Look for sites that offer moderation and the ability to report and block users who behave inappropriately.
