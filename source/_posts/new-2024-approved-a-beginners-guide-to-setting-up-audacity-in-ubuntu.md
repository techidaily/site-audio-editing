![audacity add new track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-new-track-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Select **Recording Device** from the options list. Select your microphone from the dropdown menu and hit the **Record** option.

## Comprehensive List of Advanced Speech-to-Text Apps for Mobile Devices

# Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Using speech to text apps has become increasingly common. People use voice to text apps to compose business letters and memos, transcribe meetings to document discussions, write books; in short, just about anything they want to be laid out in the written form.

In most situations, a person can think and talk a lot faster than they can type or write. That is why using speech to text apps can speed up so many situations, either in a professional or personal setting. The problem is that using speech to text apps that are not of the highest quality can be a frustrating experience. The app may poorly transcribe what you are saying, or skip entire words altogether.

Rather than making your life easier, a poorly conceived speech to text app makes things even more complicated.

## Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

Below are the ten best speech to text apps that you can use to transcribe audio to text. These apps convert audio to text seamlessly and are available for Android or iOS devices.

### 1\. [SpeechTexter (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speechtexter.speechtexter)

SpeechTexter is a free app available on the Google Play Store that you can use to create text notes, sms, emails, or tweets using your spoken words.

There is also the possibility of creating your own commands for specific punctuation, along with adding unique words into the appâ€™s dictionary.

The software allows you to work with more than 60 languages, while the recognition percentage is around 95 percent for the English language. The app does require an internet connection to work at its best, as the accuracy is lower in offline mode.

![speech texter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-speech-texter.jpg)

### 2\. [Voice Notes (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SouthernPacificOceanFisher.VoiceToText%5Fmemo)

Voice Notes is available on the Google Play Store as a free download, but there are limits on how long you can record within the free version. Users who want access to the full version must pay the premium price of $3.

The app allows you to convert speech to text to create notes, reminders, and other documents. You can group documents based on categories, get support for up to 120 languages, and toggle between 20 different user interface languages as well.

![voice notes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-voice-notes.jpg)

### 3\. [Speechnotes (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.speechnotes.speechnotes&hl=en&gl=US)

Speechnotes is a free download on the Google Play Store, with the premium version and other features available as in-app purchases for anywhere from $0.99 to $7.99.

The speech to text app makes it effortless for you to create simple text notes with your voice, record longer conversations, transcribe interviews, and complete similar tasks. You can even backup the data you save to Google Drive to ensure you do not lose any of your audio files.

Speechnotes does allow you to use the app offline, but accuracy is a lot better online.

![speech notes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-speech-notes.jpg)

### 4\. [Voice Notebook (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook)

Voice Notebook is a free download on the Google Play Store that allows you to make in-app purchases for between $2.99 to $8.99\. Those purchases would give you access to premium features within the app.

The app makes it possible for you to record voice notes and then save them onto your device or on cloud services. You can create a list of replaceable words and punctuation if you have a specific style of speaking.

There is an offline mode, but it is only available for specific languages.

Using speech to text apps has become increasingly common. People use voice to text apps to compose business letters and memos, transcribe meetings to document discussions, write books; in short, just about anything they want to be laid out in the written form.

In most situations, a person can think and talk a lot faster than they can type or write. That is why using speech to text apps can speed up so many situations, either in a professional or personal setting. The problem is that using speech to text apps that are not of the highest quality can be a frustrating experience. The app may poorly transcribe what you are saying, or skip entire words altogether.

Rather than making your life easier, a poorly conceived speech to text app makes things even more complicated.

## Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

Below are the ten best speech to text apps that you can use to transcribe audio to text. These apps convert audio to text seamlessly and are available for Android or iOS devices.

There is also the possibility of creating your own commands for specific punctuation, along with adding unique words into the appâ€™s dictionary.

The software allows you to work with more than 60 languages, while the recognition percentage is around 95 percent for the English language. The app does require an internet connection to work at its best, as the accuracy is lower in offline mode.
