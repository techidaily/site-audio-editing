**CONCLUSION**

Converting audio to text is not anymore a menial task and does not require human transcribers sitting all day long to listen to audio files. The automatic online transcription apps and platforms allow anyone to **convert mp3 to text** extremely fast and efficiently. You can transcribe any audio file just like a native speaker with 99 percent accuracy without knowing much about the process.

This strategy can benefit students, professionals, and others who want to consume information but find it hard to concentrate or remember things.
