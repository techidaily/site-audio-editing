This section will offer you a guide on how to cut out parts of audio in an iMovie project on an iPad or iPhone. After adding music to your project, the audio is trimmed to the desired length using iMovie’s inbuilt tool.

**Step #1:** Open iMovie on your iPhone or iPad.

**Step #2:** Tap the movie project you want to edit.

It will display a list of your projects, among which you must select the one you want to edit.

If you want to edit a current section of video not even opened in iMovie, you have to make a new iMovie project to add your audio and video. Select the **+** icon, choose the **Movie** tab, select the video(s), and then choose the **Create movie** button.

**Step #3:** Hit the **Edit** button below the name of your project.

This opens your project in the editor. And, you’re already in the editor if you just created a new project in the previous step.

**Step #4:** Add audio to your project.

You can skip this step if your project already contains the audio. Hit the **+** icon in the upper-left timeline's corner.

Choose **Audio**.

Go with a specific category:

Soundtracks are audio tracks provided by iMovie which are free to use in your project.

Select **My Music** to locate the file and use a song from iTunes or the music app.

Sound effects are shorter sounds—mostly below 10 seconds duration.

Choose an audio file for the preview.

Select the **+** icon to add the file to your project.

**Step #5:** Hit the audio bar on the timeline.

It is present below the multi-frame version of your video in the screen’s bottom area.

Now, detach the MP3 segment or audio from the video by tapping the video on the timeline and selecting the Detach button at the screen's bottom area.

**Step #7:** Tap and drag the end of the audio track.

You can drag the yellow bar at the end and move it to the exact point where you want the audio to end.

If you can't see the yellow bar on the far-right end of the audio track, swipe left below the audio track to scroll to the end.

To move the audio track to another location, select and hold it for about one second, and then move it to the desired video’s location.

## Part 4: Audio Editing Tips for iMovie Users

Here are some guidelines or tips for various audio editing processes, starting from cutting trim music on iMovie, using iMovie to trim audio and video together, and other audio and video editing tips.

* **Use Waveforms to See What You Hear**

Sound is just as relevant as the images in a video, and should focus just as much during editing. To efficiently and adequately edit audio, you need a good set of speakers and headphones to hear the sound, and you also need to be able to see the sound.

If the waveforms don't appear, go to the "view" drop-down menu and select "show waveforms", the waveform would show you the sound intensity level of a sound clip and definitely would give you an idea of what part will need to be turned up or down.

* **Audio Adjustments**

With the audio button situated at the top right, you have access to some essential audio editing tools for changing the sound level of your chosen clip or changing the relative volume of other films in the project.

The audio editing window also contains primary noise reduction and audio equalization tools and a range of effects – from robot to echo- which would affect how people sound in your video.

* **Editing Audio with the Timeline**

iMovie permits you to adjust the audio within the clips themselves, each volume as a bar. You can shift up and down to increase or decrease the audio level. The clips also have "fade in" and "fade out" buttons at the beginning and end, which are draggable to adjust the fade length.

## Conclusion

Finally, with the answers to the question, how to cut audio in iMovie, you can follow the simple step guide and feel free to edit your audio or video to your taste using iMovie or Wondershare Filmora.
