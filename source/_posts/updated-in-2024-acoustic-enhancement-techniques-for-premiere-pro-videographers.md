## Part 2\. Five Best Audio Trimming Tools You Can Choose

Below are the top 5 audio splitters for Mac devices you can choose to use. Read on to take a close look at them.

### 1\. [Mp3splt (Mac)](http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net/mp3splt%5Fpage/home.php)

Mp3splt(Mac) is one of the best audio splitter software available. It is open-source software that has the ability to split MP3 and Ogg Vorbis audio files. It is not only useful to split large MP3 files into smaller files or to divide entire albums into individual tracks, but also easy to use. You just need to select a start and end time position.

The best thing about Mp3splt is that it doesn’t decode the file during the splitting process, which avoids loss due to digital degeneration. If you need to split an album, you can manually input the split points and the filenames, or you can get them through CDDB or .CUE files. The audio splitter Mac software also supports automatic silence split that can be utilized to adjust split points as well as supporting ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. It is also available for Windows and Linux users.

### 2\. [Macsome Audio Splitter Freeware](http://www.macsome.com/audio-splitter-mac/)

Another free audio splitting software running on Mac computer that you can use is Macsome Audio Splitter Freeware. It can be used to split MP3 files into smaller files in just a couple of seconds. It preserves the tags and the sound quality of the files while splitting them. It also allows batch splitting, which is good if you have several audio files that you need to split. To split audio files, you can select by time or number of pieces. You can also choose the start and end time to split.

Macsome Audio Splitter Freeware has a playback feature that allows you to play the audio file and adjust its volume. The audio splitter Mac software is compatible with Mac OSX 10.4.x or 10.5.x with at least 512 MB of physical RAM. The only downside is that it can only split audio files that are unprotected or DRM-free.

![mp3-trimmer ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-trimmer.jpg)

### 5\. [AudioSlicer for Mac](http://audioslicer.sourceforge.net/)

AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI app for Mac OS X. It's designed to find all the silences in an MP3 file. It also allows you to split the audio file and tag them properly. While there are other audio splitter Mac apps that can do the tasks automatically according to specific criteria, AudioSlicer displays the silences within the specified duration. It allows you to listen to the audio before and after the silence. Then you can decide if you want to do the split at that point. Splitting of the file is done without any loss to the quality because there is no decoding or re-encoding of the audio file during the process. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 and above and supports both Intel Macs and PowerPC.
