![remove video](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-interface.jpg "remove audio from video")

Click "Import" to browse your file folder on hard disk and then pick up the videos you want to remove audio. To select multiple files, hold down the "Ctrl" button when choosing other files. All loaded files will display as thumbnails in the file tray. Doubling click them, you can preview it in the right screen window.

### 2\. Remove audio from video

![remove audio from video](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-time-line.jpg "remove audio from video")

Drag video from file tray to the Video Timeline. Right-click it and select "Audio Detach." Immediately, you'll see a separate audio file in the Music Timeline. Yes, this is the audio track of your original video. Now just hit "Delete" on the keyboard to remove the audio.

**Tips**:
1\. The files on Video Timeline will be merged seamlessly together by default. If you have multiple files to remove audio and need to save to separate files, please click the left top program icon and save to different project files first. After that, load the project file again and export the output file one by one.  
2\. You can also use the "Mute" option to remove the audio from the video, but you won't get the audio track with this option.

### 3\. Save the video

![remove audio from video file](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/output.jpg "remove audio from video file")

Double click the file in Video Timeline to check if this is what you want. If necessary, you can add some music files that fit this video. Or directly click "Create" to export only the video track. Pick your wanted format to save it on your computer in the pop-up format window.
