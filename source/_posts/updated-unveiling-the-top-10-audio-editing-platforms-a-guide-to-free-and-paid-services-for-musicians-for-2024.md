However, online content producers often need music for their videos, but they neither have the time or the budget to hire a professional musician to create a soundtrack for their project in studio conditions. If you are looking for a quick way to make your own music online, then you should keep reading, because in this article we are going to take you through the ten best online music makers you should check out in 2021.

online-music-maker-Text to Speech.jpg

Vocals are often overlooked in contemporary electronic music, but there are so many ways they can be used creatively. The platform lets you turn up to 50000 characters into speech at once, and it also offers several different voices you can choose from. Before you create an audio file you can determine how fast the text is going to be vocalized, so you should try different options and see which one fits your project the best.

The Looplab’s studio features samples for a broad range of music genres and musical instruments, and you can use it to make Electro or Funk music equally effectively.

#### 9. [Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/)

**Price:** Free

![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-online-Sequencer.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>

The platform also lets you import MIDI files and work on projects you’ve already started developing or you can export your sequences as MIDI files from the Online Sequencer and edit them with your DAW. Even though Online Sequencer is a useful tool for making music, the features it offers can’t really be compared with those on Soundation or AudioSauna.

![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-Autochords.jpg)

Finding new ideas for songs is often more difficult than it sounds, and if you ever face a creative block you should simply head over to Autochords. This platform suggests chord progressions based on the parameters you set, so you just have to select an instrument and the name of the song to set the feel, and the platform will show you the main progression and its alternatives. Rather than being an online music maker, Autochords is more a tool that helps piano and guitar players understand chord progressions better. iPhone and iPad users can download the Autochords app from the App Store for free.
