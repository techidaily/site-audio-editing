02 [Online Video Editor with Music](#Part 2)

03 [Free Music Video Editor App](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Music Video Editor Software for PC

Those who have a computer will be glad to know that adding music to a video should be fairly easy. Not only are most modern PCs quite powerful for such basic video editing tasks, but you can also find a wide range of video editor software for PC out there.

It comes with advanced video effects, color grading options, keyframing support, green screen support, motion tracking options, a sound design panel, and much more.

As a result, you can also use it for basic tasks like adding music to video files without any issues as shown in these steps:

● Here, you can find an option to browse, find, and open the music tracks that you want to add to your videos.

● If you do not know how to download music on laptops or desktop PCs, you may not be able to add music using this method.

● Thankfully, you can then go to the Filmora Media Library, where you can find more than 50 music tracks. These music tracks are completely free to use for adding to your videos.

● Once you have selected the right music track using either of these methods, you can find it in the project library.

## Part 2 Online Video Editor with Music

If you want to learn how to edit music into a video, but you do not have a powerful computer, it can be an issue. This is because most entry-level computers and older computers won’t be able to run a heavy tempo music video with effects that require a powerful computer. Fortunately, you can still edit videos on your computer to add music to them. Thanks to the wide range of online video editors out there, you can do this. As a result, you can make a video with pictures and music online using any web browser.

![online editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/music-editor-1.png)

Since almost everyone wants to edit videos and music in them, you can find all kinds of online video editors. While some are paid, almost all others are entirely free to use. And if you are editing videos online using a web browser, likely, you are not familiar with video editors. As a result, it is also quite important to ensure that any given online video editor is also easy to use. After keeping all of these factors in mind, the [Add Audio in Video tool by Online Converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com/add-audio-to-video) is a great option.

● You have to first open the Add Audio in Video tool in any web browser of your choice.

● After opening this website, click on the Choose File option under the Video section. Then, browse and find the video file that you want to edit for adding music.

● Once the right video file is selected, you need to click on the Choose File option under the Audio File section. Then, like the video file, browse and choose the audio file you want to add to your video.

● Now, change the Options toggle to Replace Audio in Video or as you prefer. You can also change the Volume and Position options as desired.

02 [How to Change Your Voice in Practice?](#part2)

03 [How to Change Your Voice with Voice Changer Apps?](#part3)

## Part 1\. What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?

Naturally, a person’s voice changes with time. Although time is not only the reason, the environment also plays an essential role in changing voice. The environment has a significant effect on the way someone walks, talks, or even how someone acts on something. There are various factors upon which your voice sounds unique and special; some of these factors are briefly discussed below:

![factors making sound unique](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-your-voice-1.jpg)

### 1\. Gender

Females have small vocal cords as compared to males since birth. Then at puberty, the rise in the testosterone level causes the larynx to enlarge, and that changes your voice. Over time, the vocal cords thicken and tighten, which creates a vibration in sound along with deeper resonance. For females, the cords do not get tight, which results in a high pitch in the female voice.

### 2\. Structure of Anomalies

The structure of anomalies is referred to as cleft palates deviated spectrum. Anomalies affect the clearness that is in a person's voice. The structure of one's voice can be altered by the age, overall health, cleanliness, and emotional state of a person. Alongside the texture of sound, pitch and timbre can also change your voice.

### 3\. Body Structure

Bodyweight plays a vital role in changing voice. Obese men produce excessive estrogen that causes a rise in their voices. On the contrary, obese women have excessive testosterone that makes their voice deeper than others. Being obese makes the breath control better that results in generating a raspy sound.

### 4\. Height

Underweight people have less endurance which increases the chance of injury to vocal cords. In comparison, heightened people have comparatively bigger lungs and larger lower airways, causing them to produce deeper voices compared to short people.

### 5\. Heredity

Heredity and genetics play an important role in shaping your voice as it is a part of your anatomy too. Genetics is why you might find people from the same family have similar voices. Sound is made by the vocal cords that are in the larynx. The larynx is given a genetic code, which alters itself over time. These alterations, as a reaction, change your voice.

## Part 2\. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?

There are multiple reasons why someone wants to change their voice. Someone might not be satisfied with their low pitch voice or want to have a deeper voice. At the same time, you might also want to change your voice to any frictional character. Or you might want to change your voice to Morgan freeman too.

### Change the Way you Talk

Expressions change the emotions that affect the voice. Nasal and non-nasal voices differ as the nasal voices have a higher pitch as compared to non-nasal sounds. Changing the accent also affects the voice. The voice apparently stays the same, but the hearings of words change to make others feel the change of voice—for example, American and British accents.

### Taking Care of Vocal Cords

Taking care of vocal cords can help change your voice. Smoking causes loss of voice and lowers the range of voice. Screaming can damage the vocal cords that automatically affects the voice. Breathing in polluted air not only changes the voice but also damages the vocal cords.

### Vocal Exercises

There are some exercises that relax the vocal cords. These exercises include massaging the throat to loosen tense muscles, humming, taking deep breaths. Another exercise is loosening the jaw by opening it wide and closing it gently. Lip buzzing, yawning, and tongue trills are also considered exercises for vocal cords that can change your voice.
