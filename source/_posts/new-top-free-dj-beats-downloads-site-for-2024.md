**Step 4: Export Audio File**

Once you are done editing the audio, you can easily save it across your device. For that, tap on "Export" to open a new window. Across the "Local" section, select "MP3" from the list of formats and figuratively set all the other settings before tapping on "Export."

#### 3\.  FL Studio 12.1.2

This digital editing workstation is definitely not for beginners. Trained professionals who are familiar with editing software will not have a lot of trouble adjusting to this format. This is a professional tool that offers a convenient platform for editing and mixing.

#### 4\. [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

Here you will get a mix of simplicity and professionalism. It is easy to get used to but progresses in complexity with time.

#### 5\. [Wavosaur](https://www.wavosaur.com/)

Wavosaur is an old tool that doesn’t run on most modern computers and laptops. But it does offer many features and methods of processing for audio clips.
