## Editing Basics that Beginners’ Should Keep in Mind

The list below is the critical podcast editing basics a beginner should follow before publishing the podcast. Overall, it would be awesome if you learn new skills instead of outsourcing the whole stuff. That’s fantastic as well!

**Firstly, import the audio.**

The editing process starts with importing the audio track. The audio material in the sequence must be at the primary place. Always place the audio track in the first position even if you are importing multiple audio tracks. You can leave the track underneath for editing purposes. After adding this first audio file, you can add sound effects, music, and other secondary audio files for further editing.

**Listen again**

Don’t proceed before re-listening your added audio! This manner will let you think for different sections, and you can further decide what to keep and what to preserve. Remove any computer noise, background hiss, and unwanted audio areas. Here, you can help with different noise reduction tools available or go for the reliable podcast editing software, specifically the audio ducking feature for noise removal.

**Make it consistent throughout**

The next step is to make the volume consistent at every stage of the podcast. After removing all the unwanted noises, take the necessary action to normalize the audio levels and specifically select -2.0 for peak amplitude. Amplify the tranquil areas.

**Sound Designing and Mixing**

Then, you are required to do sound designing and mixing for the podcast. Take it lightly and only especially when you are a beginner. Add the sound effects as per the message of the podcast. Always keep in mind to use significant sound effects that effectively evoke the emotion and ultimately save the audience engaged. The mixing part comes when you compress, equalize, and process the audio to adjust accordingly in the different sections.

**Preview and Post**

Once your podcast is edited and ready, preview it ensure everything is in place, especially if it is your first time. It would be best to post a clear, concise, and to the point audio/video. Finally, post your podcast, either for free or using one of the software available online on your desired blog/online media.

## Which DAW should you use?

## Advanced Editing Tips to Spice Up Your Podcasts

Don't miss out on this portion if you want to upgrade your podcasting skills like professionals! Learn some advanced formulas of podcast audio editing as follows.

**Trim the Ends**

It's better if you trim the ends before editing the podcast. And, make sure there are no blanks at the beginning or end of the podcast. You can also add fade-in or fade-out effects to avoid unprofessional vibes.

**Work on your planning and presentation skills**

Instead, focus on being confident while presenting the podcast so that you will need to have significantly fewer editing issues or may not need editing at all. Think upon changing the approach of podcast recording as well.

**Provide margin and look for transitions**

Offer a little margin and say that thing smoothly again if you have misread or misspell the statement while recording the podcast. Thus, you must not squeeze the information that doesn't provide a better room for podcast editing. The provided margin will make it a breeze to cut out the messy audio portion.

Then, you have to look for transitions precisely when you are recording in multiple tracks, co-hosting, or taking a long space while recording your podcast. These transitions could be like pointless babbles, awkward silences, cross talks, etc., that need careful watch at both the beginning and the end. Most of the editing will improve by considering and editing these kinds of transitions.

**Eliminate awkward silences**

Sometimes a podcast is full of awkward silences that look crap at all. Well, you don’t have to remove every silence taken at the end of a talk or something like that. Eliminate only long, awkward silences or reduce their duration. Different plugins are available within the DAWs to remove these background noises and long duration silences.

**Adjust the volume of the podcast**

It may be a bit tricky to edit the podcast when one person or interviewee is a lot quieter. First of all, check if their microphone signals and settings are strong enough to provide you with audio. Then, you can increase the gain of their speaker before podcast editing. Normalize the voice or add some compression to increase the loudness ultimately.

**Save podcast to the right format**

Finally, you must be careful while exporting your podcast to the correct format to ensure the best quality. Go to the export settings and find MP3 extension and 192kbps bitrate.

## Editing Basics that Beginners’ Should Keep in Mind

Well, it is all dependent upon the approach you follow regarding the podcast audio editing. There are various podcast editing services, and styles worth consider. The list below is the critical podcast editing basics a beginner should follow before publishing the podcast. Overall, it would be awesome if you learn new skills instead of outsourcing the whole stuff. That’s fantastic as well!

**Firstly, import the audio.**

The editing process starts with importing the audio track. The audio material in the sequence must be at the primary place. Always place the audio track in the first position even if you are importing multiple audio tracks. You can leave the track underneath for editing purposes. After adding this first audio file, you can add sound effects, music, and other secondary audio files for further editing.

**Listen again**

Don’t proceed before re-listening your added audio! This manner will let you think for different sections, and you can further decide what to keep and what to preserve. Remove any computer noise, background hiss, and unwanted audio areas. Here, you can help with different noise reduction tools available or go for the reliable podcast editing software, specifically the audio ducking feature for noise removal.

**Make it consistent throughout**

The next step is to make the volume consistent at every stage of the podcast. After removing all the unwanted noises, take the necessary action to normalize the audio levels and specifically select -2.0 for peak amplitude. Amplify the tranquil areas.

**Sound Designing and Mixing**

Then, you are required to do sound designing and mixing for the podcast. Take it lightly and only especially when you are a beginner. Add the sound effects as per the message of the podcast. Always keep in mind to use significant sound effects that effectively evoke the emotion and ultimately save the audience engaged. The mixing part comes when you compress, equalize, and process the audio to adjust accordingly in the different sections.

**Preview and Post**

Once your podcast is edited and ready, preview it ensure everything is in place, especially if it is your first time. It would be best to post a clear, concise, and to the point audio/video. Finally, post your podcast, either for free or using one of the software available online on your desired blog/online media.

## Which DAW should you use?

You can’t miss using Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for podcast editing at any cost. It is an audio editing program with all the facilities right from recording the podcast to editing it. To start with, you must consider using among the following three DAWs.

**Audacity**

## Advanced Editing Tips to Spice Up Your Podcasts

Don't miss out on this portion if you want to upgrade your podcasting skills like professionals! Learn some advanced formulas of podcast audio editing as follows.

**Trim the Ends**

It's better if you trim the ends before editing the podcast. And, make sure there are no blanks at the beginning or end of the podcast. You can also add fade-in or fade-out effects to avoid unprofessional vibes.

**Work on your planning and presentation skills**

Focus on having a time-saving podcast editing by working upon your planning and presentation skills. Don’t be that guy who tries to edit every verbal crutch. Instead, focus on being confident while presenting the podcast so that you will need to have significantly fewer editing issues or may not need editing at all. Think upon changing the approach of podcast recording as well.

**Provide margin and look for transitions**

Offer a little margin and say that thing smoothly again if you have misread or misspell the statement while recording the podcast. Thus, you must not squeeze the information that doesn't provide a better room for podcast editing. The provided margin will make it a breeze to cut out the messy audio portion.

Then, you have to look for transitions precisely when you are recording in multiple tracks, co-hosting, or taking a long space while recording your podcast. These transitions could be like pointless babbles, awkward silences, cross talks, etc., that need careful watch at both the beginning and the end. Most of the editing will improve by considering and editing these kinds of transitions.

**Eliminate awkward silences**

Sometimes a podcast is full of awkward silences that look crap at all. Well, you don’t have to remove every silence taken at the end of a talk or something like that. Eliminate only long, awkward silences or reduce their duration. Different plugins are available within the DAWs to remove these background noises and long duration silences.

**Adjust the volume of the podcast**

It may be a bit tricky to edit the podcast when one person or interviewee is a lot quieter. First of all, check if their microphone signals and settings are strong enough to provide you with audio. Then, you can increase the gain of their speaker before podcast editing. Normalize the voice or add some compression to increase the loudness ultimately.

**Save podcast to the right format**

Finally, you must be careful while exporting your podcast to the correct format to ensure the best quality. Go to the export settings and find MP3 extension and 192kbps bitrate.

## Edit Podcast with Video Editor

Are you recording a video podcast? If yes, you must make very little room for editing while considering the best recording equipment and settings. Secondly, you can look for a high-tech video editor that can do the task of both video editing and podcast editing. The Wondershare Filmora X is one such famous name in the world of video editing.
