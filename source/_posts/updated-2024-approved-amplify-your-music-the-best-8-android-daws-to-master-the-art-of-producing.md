## How to uninstall Audacity Ubuntu

For whatever reason, if you wish to remove the Audacity program from your computer, you may follow these instructions.

### Method 1

If you installed Audacity through the Snap method, execute the following command in your terminal: **$ sudo snap remove Audacity**

### Method 2

If you have installed the application using the PPA, you may remove it by performing the instructions shown below.

\>**Step** 1:

The first step is to

This indicates that the add-apt-repository command was used to add the PPA to your system. You may also use the same command to uninstall the PPA from your computer. Simply include the —remove option in your command.

**$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**

\>**Step** 2:

As of the right moment, the PPA has been withdrawn. What happens to the programs that are installed using these PPAs? Will they be eliminated as a consequence of the abolition of the Patriot Act? The answer is a resounding no.

Thus, PPA-purge enters the scene to help solve the problem. The PPA is disabled, but all of the apps installed by the PPA are also uninstalled, or they are reverted to the original versions given by your distribution.

Install the PPA-purge package and remove the Audacity package may be accomplished by running the following command.

**$ sudo apt install ppa-purge && sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**
