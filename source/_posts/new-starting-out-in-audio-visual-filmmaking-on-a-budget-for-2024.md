### 4\. Disable Noisy or Electrical Machinery

Another way of reducing sound is to minimize the presence of noisy tech in the surroundings. This includes turning off any electrical equipment near the recorder. Machinery like refrigerators, fans, and air conditioners. This is because sometimes the human ear cannot detect a sound, but microphones can.

### 5\. Track and Maintain Audio Levels

This is a post-editing technique that involves the use of statistics to maintain audio. Many editing or recording tools feature audio levels. This will help in monitoring any high or low frequencies in videos. Later, they can manage noise by observing the audio levels.
