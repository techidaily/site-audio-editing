## How to Choose a DAW Software

Often, choosing the DAW software best suited to your needs can be confusing. However, a few simple questions will help you narrow down your list. Are recording instrumentals or live singing? Do you wish to use samples, in-built sounds, and loops? Are you low on budget?

Although DAW software can cost a fortune, many of these software's are accessible free with a few limitations. For instance, Studio One Prime V4, despite being free, does not support VST plug-ins. Similarly, Roland Zenbeats also requires money to be able to access additional features and VST plug-ins. One of the most favorite DAW software, namely Cakewalk by Bandlab, offers exceptional features complete with VST plug-in support but is limited to use on Windows only.

Hence, it seems like you can't have everything in one software. Even the best, free DAW software lack a feature or two. But despite lacking a few high-end features, the free DAW software's are productive enough, owing to the rapid technological advancements, to render your audios flawless and professional sounding.

## Conclusion

Irrespective of the fact that the above set of free DAW software is pretty easy than the others, each one of them requires some time to get accustomed. If you ever get stuck while handling the above best DAW for beginners, always remember to refer to the online learning videos that come handy to serve you better.

Once you get the hang of the software, you can easily manage it with ease.

### Step 3: Record and add your voiceover to video
