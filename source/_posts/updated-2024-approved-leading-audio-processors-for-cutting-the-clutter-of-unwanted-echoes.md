Omegle is a widely used web-based platform that allows you to communicate with other users via text messages, voice messages, and video calls. It connects you to strangers for discussion and chats. It was launched in 2009, as a chatting platform. But after some time it introduced a video conferencing feature to let people see each other instead of just chatting via messages. Today, it is more than just a chatting platform, millions of users use it throughout the world and enabling them to connect with strangers and making them friends. In 2012, it removed the restriction of filtered chatting and made the chat unmonitored. Letting people talk and exchange messages, images, and videos of their own choice without being restricted. But it also imposed the restriction of 13 years of age to use this platform. To avoid inappropriate messages and videos, they started using an image recognition algorithm. But it didn't prevent sending and receiving adult content via video or text messages. The reason behind its popularity among teenagers is its ability to connect you with strangers without letting them see your personal information. The user can filter the strangers based on their age, gender, and location to get connected with their preferred individuals. In 2014, the developers brought a new advancement and feature into Omegle, allowing users with .edu emails provided by their institutions to pair with their peers anonymously without letting them know your real name and other personal information.
