##### Liza Brown

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Creating a soundtrack for a video is one of the most overlooked steps of the[video editing process](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Music can make any video more dynamic and more entertaining to watch. Exporting a video without [background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or voiceover included is generally considered a bad practice.

**Adding music to video online** is a good choice because you donâ€™t need to install any video editing software on your computer. Sometimes, if the desktop video editing app installed doesnâ€™t have [a library of royalty-free music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you have to uninstall and try other software. With online solutions, you wonâ€™t worry about this. There are several [online video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can use to add music to a video for free. In this article, Iâ€™ll share with you about how to add music to video online.

## How to Add Music to a Video Online for Free \[7 Ways\]

Editing videos online has its downsides, since some platforms have video size limitations, while others offer only a basic set of video editing tools. Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesnâ€™t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, letâ€™s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.

### 1\. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio

A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after theyâ€™ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesnâ€™t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.

There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the **Creator Studio Classic** tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.

![Add Music to YouTube Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-2.jpg)

Select Audio Option

Click on the **Edit** drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the **Audio** option. Start browsing through YouTubeâ€™s collection of royalty-free music and click on the **ADD TO VIDEO** button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the **Save Changes** button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.

Optionally you can also download music and audio effects from YouTube Studioâ€™s Audio Library first, and then add the downloaded music to videos with the video editor you have installed on your computer.

## How to Add Music to a Video Online for Free \[7 Ways\]

Editing videos online has its downsides, since some platforms have video size limitations, while others offer only a basic set of video editing tools. Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesnâ€™t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, letâ€™s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.

### 1\. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio

A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after theyâ€™ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesnâ€™t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.

There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the **Creator Studio Classic** tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.

Click on the **Edit** drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the **Audio** option. Start browsing through YouTubeâ€™s collection of royalty-free music and click on the **ADD TO VIDEO** button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the **Save Changes** button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.
