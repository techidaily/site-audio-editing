So, letâ€™s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.

Robots canâ€™t be creative, right? A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You donâ€™t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it. So, letâ€™s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.

Soon after, the AI published its first oeuvre titled â€˜Opus 1 for Piano Solo and in the subsequent years, AIVA released an album and composed music for a video game.
