## How To Normalize Audio In DaVinci Resolve

## How To Normalize Audio In DaVinci Resolve

It happens a lot of times that we are not satisfied with several details our videos and audios contain, and we need to edit them. One of the most common problems we face is that our volumes are not normalized, and we need to take some extra time in order to achieve the best result for our audiences. Even with little or no knowledge about this very specific topic, we need to inform ourselves and find the solutions, make our videos more watch-able and our audios more listen-able, so to say.

There are several ways the audio normalization is achieved. One type is called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; the second is loudness normalization, adjusting the recording based on perceived loudness. RMS (Root-Mean-Square) changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.

Mostly, there are two reasons why we should give audio normalization a try. You need to decide yourself, what is your reason and expected outcome when you use audio normalization. First is when your aim is to get the maximum volume, but the second boils down to matching different volumes with each other.

When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.

More concretely, in general, audio normalization is when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, “the norm” for the project. It means that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.

You can have the desired result using different kinds of software. Nowadays, a lot of programs offer you the tool which facilitates this process. So, one of them would be DaVinci Resolve, which we are going to discuss in this article.

What is DaVinci Resolve? The description goes: “DaVinci Resolve is the world’s only solution that combines editing, color correction, visual effects, motion graphics and audio post production all in one software tool!” so, let’s discover what this software can do to help us balance the audio!

So, how to balance your audio in DaVinci Resolve? We are going to discuss everything step by step – how to set your target loudness level, how to monitor the loudness, and how you can use the automation feature.

Well, of course, have the program installed and opened. Then, add your video with the audio you want to edit or the audio separately, if that’s what you are aiming to do.

The first step you need to make is to set your target loudness level – for this, find the little settings button on the right bottom of the program and click on it. Now, go down to the Fairlight menu and change the Target Loudness Level. If you are doing the audio normalization for the Youtube content, then it is recommended to set it to -14 LUFS.

![set target loudness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-1.jpg)

Next, you are going to head to the Fairlight page and make sure that your meters are open. the loudness meter is on the right top of the layout of the program, and it goes from +9 to -15 LUFS.

![make sure open the meters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-2.jpg)

Here, zero represents exactly what our target loudness level is, in this case, as you remember, we set it to -14 LUFS. So, ensure that our loudness is as close as zero as possible on the meter, but you can also make it lower, such as -3\. Whenever you play, you will be able to see that there are some numbers popping up to the right of the meter.

![set loudness as close as zero](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-3.jpg)

The first one, you’ll find, is Short – constantly changing, indicating how far above or below the target loudness level you are at a given time. Short Max tells you how far above or below your target loudness level the loudest point of your video is. Range is a measure of your quietest pick to your loudest peak, and the last one is Integrated – it gives you the overall loudness of your video in relation to your target loudness level. Integrated is the number we aim to keep around -3 or 0.

We can use our main slider (next to the sequence on the right) to make our video louder or quieter until we hit that target loudness level.

![makee video louder or quieter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-4.jpg)

Also, there is an automation tool that can help you dial in your loudness. In order to access this feature, find a red icon, looking like a wave with kind of a key frames.

![automation tool help dial in loudness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-5.jpg)

Next, open up your Index (on the far top panel, a little bit from the left), and make sure you are in the tracks menu in your editing index.

![open index](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-6.jpg)

What you want to do is to make your main track visible on the timeline, so hit on the eyeball next to your main and go to your timeline, where you will expand your main track until you see your Loudness History options.

![make sure main track visible](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-7.jpg)

Here, you will need to check in the box next to Integrated and turn on the Loudness History. This will show the integrated loudness level, adjust your main track’s volume accordingly, so you are below the zero line. And, that’s actually it!
