Merging audios is combining several audio files into one. We usually select the songs whose styles are similar with each other. Then, we can adjust the playback speed and combine them into a new one. Besides, we can mix two songs. For example, we can mix the narrator’s words into a song. By this way, listeners can understand the meaning while enjoying the songs.

The end of the deletion area can be marked similarly – play the audio and select the final point of the area to be excluded from the output audio, and then press the “Split” button again.
