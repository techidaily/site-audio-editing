* Loading and editing audio
* Recording new tracks
* Mixing and applying effects
* Mastering
* Exporting finished mixes

After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.

* 4k (cymbals)
* 90 Hz (kick drum)
* 150 Hz (snare drum)

Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.
