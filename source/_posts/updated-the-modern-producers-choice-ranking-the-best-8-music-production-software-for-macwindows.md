You need to consider two things while choosing the best music production software-

**Budget** – [Considering the budget is at the top of the list](https://www.payoff.com/life/money/5-simple-steps-to-create-a-successful-budget/) in the music equipment guides. It is a sort of an investment like your car, so you would definitely want to have something that is enduring and gives you value for money.

There are definitely many free music production software available, but it is always recommended to save a few hundred dollars and get something that you can stick with for a long-term.

Before opting for the paid versions of these music production software for Windows and Mac, it is always better to check the trial version of it and then, go ahead with the purchase only if you are satisfied.

**Your Music Editing Experience** – If you are just starting out with music production, then it is pointless to go mad with the DAW terms. You may find the Pro Tools difficult so the investment makes no sense. It is obvious to start with a tool that is [easy to understand and easily comprehensible for audio editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The expert level software can make your learning task time consuming as well as daunting. If you are an experienced player, the Pro Tools might be tough to a certain extent but an ultimate investment for a long time.
