## Elevating Your Voice: How to Enhance Your Podcast Experience Using Audacity

Free audio recording & editing software audacity for podcasts is available for Windows, Linux, & macOS. Even though it's not expressly built for podcasts, it is a popular option for recording podcasts. If you don't mind a steep learning curve, you can easily record, edit, & export a high-quality podcast with this software.

## How to Record a Podcast using Audacity

Despite its complexity, audacity for podcasts doesn't need a detailed understanding of the software's internals to begin using it. As a beginner, we explain all of the initial settings and basic editing choices you'll need to know and how to output in a format that can be used for podcasting.

Here's how to get started recording your podcast using Audacity for Podcasts:

* By selecting the box to the left of your microphone, you may choose your audio host. Select MME for Windows and Core Audio for Mac OS X.

![record-podcast-using-audacity1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast-using-audacity1.png)

* Select the audio interface or microphone from the menu to the right of the microphone icon. In order to record your Audacity for Podcasts, Audacity utilizes the device that you pick from this menu.

![record-podcast-using-audacity2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast-using-audacity2.png)

* Select your headphones by checking the box to the right of a speaker symbol. To playback, the audio files, Audacity for Podcasts utilizes the device you specify from this option.

![record-podcast-using-audacity3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast-using-audacity3.png)

## What you need to know about Audacity's Input Tester

Test your input before you begin recording your podcast. This helps you to make totally clear that everything is set up properly and that your podcast is recorded.

* The monitor meter may be found on the menu bar at the very top, at the very center. "Click to begin monitoring" is what it says.

![audacity-input-test1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-input-test1.png)

* Speak normally into the microphone you've placed on your computer.

![audacity-input-test2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-input-test2.png)

* Ensure that the Microphone Volume meter doesn't go over -12dB by adjusting the volume controls.

![audacity-input-test3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-input-test3.png)

## Audacity for Podcasts Recording Tutorial

Audacity recording is simple after you've set up all of the settings you need. Make sure to pick just one (Mono) Recording Channel while you're recording with a single microphone.

Each microphone is assigned a separate audio channel if you have numerous microphones connected to an audio interface or mixer. There must be a separate microphone and channel for each participant on your podcast so that you can edit them separately and make sure they all sound well together.

Each of these mono channels will be blended into stereo when you export your podcast later.

There is nothing complicated about the actual recording procedure.

* To begin recording your podcast, press the red Record button.

![recording-tutorial1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recording-tutorial1.png)

* When you've finished recording your podcast, press the black Stop button.

![recording-tutorial2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recording-tutorial2.png)

* Once you've finished recording, use Ctrl+S to save the project. If Audacity crashes or you shut it by mistake, you won't be able to recover your edited audio file.

## Using Audacity to Edit Your Podcast

Audacity for Podcasts not only allows you to record your podcast, but it also allows you to edit it afterward. It is possible to send your raw podcast to the internet as soon as you complete the recording, but editing may add a degree of polish that makes it more pleasurable for the listener.

You may use Audacity to re-arrange your podcast's flow by cutting and relocating portions, reducing clipping, and even deleting background noise if one of your mics was too near or someone was talking too loudly. Audacity can even alter the levels of individual recordings.

Some of these editing chores are more difficult than others, but if you just have high-quality equipment & have your settings ideal, the podcast may not need a lot of effort. Check over a few different portions of your podcast to get a sense of how much work has to be done on it before publishing.
