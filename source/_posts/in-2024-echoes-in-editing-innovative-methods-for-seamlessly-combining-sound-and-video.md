### Fix 2: Check the Applicationâ€™s Version

Another reason that might be causing the problem is an incompatible version of the application with Clownfish. Both the voice changer and the application must have compatible versions. You can take assistance from the steps below to check the version of Skype.

Step 1: Start by opening Skype, and then from the left menu pane, click on your Skype profile. Then, from the quick access menu list, look for the â€˜Settingsâ€™ option.

![open skype settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-15.jpg)

Step 2: After the â€˜Settingsâ€™ window opens, click on the 'Help & Feedbackâ€™ option once located from the left pane. As the Help & Feedback screen opens, you will see the Skype logo on the screen, and under the logo, you will see the version of Skype.

### Fix 3: Microphone Installation in Clownfish

The Voice changer is of no use if the microphone cannot be used as a microphone is an essential component for using a voice changer. An outdated microphone or wrongly installed microphone can cause an error in using Clownfish voice change.

Step 1: Run Clownfish on the computer and open it from the taskbar icon by right-clicking it. Keep your mouse over 'Setupâ€™ till the sub-menu opens.

Step 2: From the sub-menu, click on â€˜System Integration.' Then, select the microphone which is working fine, and click on 'Install,' which will install the microphone automatically.

Step 3: After the installation of the microphone, reboot the computer. Check whether the microphone error is resolved or not.

### Bottom Line

Clownfish voice changer is a famous and known software with many amazing features and functionalities. The article above has shared great details about the voice changer and its use on Skype, Discord, and Fortnite.

Additionally, let's talk about video editing software. As the videos need editing after they are filmed so, why not use Wondershare Filmora for editing your videos? The software offers some crazy and cool features like cut, trim, split, crop, etc.
