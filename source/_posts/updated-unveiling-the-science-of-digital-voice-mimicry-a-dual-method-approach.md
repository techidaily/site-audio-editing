## "Best Chromecast Microphones for High-Quality Sound Capture "

Google Chrome is one of the most frequently used and reputable web browsers. We use it all the time. Be it finding our answers, playing streaming music, watching tutorials, playing games, and more. Sometimes, we may need to record and save audio from the browser. But we do not always have the permission or authorization to download it from the web. In this case, recording with a powerful chrome audio recorder is a good solution. Here in this article, we have come up with 6 top chrome audio recorders for you. Let's get into it now!

## Part 1: The Best Chrome Audio Recorder- Chrome Audio Capture

There are many chrome audio recorders available to use, but do you know the best one? There is a chrome extension called Chrome Audio Capture for the same. We'll tell you step by step how to install it and use it as a chrome audio recorder.

Here’s How to Record Audio on Chrome Audio Recorder-

Step 1\. On chrome web store, search "Chrome Audio Capture".

![search chrome audio capture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/chrome-audio-recorder-15.jpg)

Step 2\. Click "Add to Chrome" to download this extension and install it

![add to chrome](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/chrome-audio-recorder-16.jpg)

This is the last screen that you'll see on your system. Now you know how you can capture the voice on the current tab and save the output file on your computer.
