A good **dictation software** makes it easy and simple to transcribe documents, take notes, and help people who struggle at typing gather information easily.

Dictation apps were not much used before because of the lesser accuracy and more errors. But now it has come a long way and dictation apps are faster and accurate now more than ever. The use of AI, speech recognition, etc. has enabled dictation software to perform as fast as a person is reading.

Dictation software has also helped to empower people who find it difficult to type because of their disabilities. So here in this article let’s find out the best dictation software that you can use while in meetings, to transcribe documents, take notes, and much more.

## Top 8 Dictation Software/Apps

A good dictation software must be fast, accurate, and must give very little space for errors. Let’s talk about 8 such speech-to-text softwares that can make things easier at some point in your life.

### 1\. Google Docs Voice Typing

![google-docs-dictation-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-google-docs-dictation-software.jpg)

Google docs voice typing is one of the best tools for transcribing texts. This feature has been added a few years back and it is completely free. This feature is very accurate and fast, but will only be available when you are using the online app in Chrome.

Some of its features include voice dictation, integration to google cloud, and availability in both Windows and Mac devices.

**Price**: Free

### 2\. Dictation.io

![dictation-io-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-dictation-io-software.jpg)

Dictation.io is an application that will allow you to type with your voice in English or any language of your choice. It uses speech recognition to transcribe accurately and can help you write documents and emails very easily.

The transcribing happens in real-time using the dictation app and it also allows to add punctuation marks, paragraphs, and smileys through voice commands. This app requires an internet connection and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux without any issues. Dictation has a simple interface and all the necessary tools needed to do necessary edits, which makes it very easy to use.

**Price**: Free

### 3\. Braina

![braina-dictation-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-braina-dictation-software.jpg)

Braina is more than a voice-to-text converting application. Apart from the ability to dictate in more than 90 languages accurately, Braina can also control applications using voice commands. It makes use of AI and voice recognition to execute voice commands and convert to text accurately.

Brania can eliminate the need for a keyboard as it can control almost everything on your computer. Mathematical calculations, internet searches, opening folders, and files, no matter what you ask, it is capable of doing everything. Another plus point of Braina is that it understands accents and almost all medical, scientific and legal terms, which makes it easier while transcribing.

**Price**: Braina Lite - Free, Pro version - $49 per year, Pro Lifetime - $139

**User Rating:** 4.0

In case you would like to sound like your favorite movie star of TV host, then Celebrity Voice Changer is one of the best choices you can make. Besides the standard set of options, the app also lets you request new voices since its machine learning technology can mimic virtually anyone's voice. However, Celebrity Voice Changer is currently only available in English and it cannot modulate speech in other languages.

**Pros**

* Automatic voice modulation
* Huge selection of voice filters
* The app generates video files that are better adjusted to the audience on social media than audio files
