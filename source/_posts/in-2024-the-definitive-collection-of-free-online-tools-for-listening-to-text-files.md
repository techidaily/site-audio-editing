## Echoes of Rebellion: Celebrating the Top 15 Most Captivating Rock Songs of 2 Written By

It wasn't easy getting through 2021\. But the world of rock background music made it a bit easier. This is how 2021 killed the myth that rock ever vanished. Let's check out some of these gems that can create a rock vibe for you to enjoy.

## Top 15 Rock Songs

We have come up with varied songs by singers all around the globe who create a classic rock vibe for listeners with hip hop background music.

### 1\. Ann Wilson, "Black Wing"

Wilson was inspired to write "Black Wing" on birds that are pure flying spirits that connect the threads of nature. You'll experience monstrous drums and power chords. This song uses delicate acoustic strums and a repeating keyboard riff to show contrasts in the world.

### 2\. Tears for Fears, "No Small Thing"

The legends, Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith are best known for the pop hits like "Shout" and "Everybody Wants to Rule the World."

For once in nearly 18 years, the duo taps into a folk-rock sound. It's something new and darker for the band, but it doesn't feel forced. They still represent the previous work that made them what they are today. "No Small Things" proves that even after 40 years of their coming, they still have so much to offer to the world.

### 3\. Rise Against, "Nowhere Generation"

Rise Against speaks for the marginalized people out there through his songs. This title track of their latest album is one of the most poignant songs in their entire catalogue. The lyrics hone in on the idealism of the "American dream" related to a current generation of youths growing up in a world of social, economic and political instability.

### 4\. [As Everything Unfolds - On The Inside (Official Video)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZIR9QXRmzAY)

### 8\. [Dorothy - What's Coming To Me](https://youtu.be/WJSEkBx8H%5FM)

Dorothy shifted from a high energy rock' n' roll to sweet, free-spirited music during her first two records. Now she has come up with an even more bouncy high energy track, "What's Coming to Me." The chorus is impressive; her vocals are sharper than ever, and it sounds more mature all around.

### 9\. [ANDREW W.K. - Everybody Sins (Official Video) | Napalm Records](https://youtu.be/Yk8wi4XcQgk)

Andrew W.K. released the album cheeky God Is Partying in 2021, which features the single "Everybody Sins." The track has a catchy guitar sound, yet it is brutally heavy.
