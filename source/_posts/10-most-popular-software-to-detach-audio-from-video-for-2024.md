A professional editing tool would be an ideal helper to do this (hence, the reason you’re here). While a great variety of music management software and video editors support adding audio to images, Wondershare Filmora stands out for its efficiency, simplicity, and robust capability.

To get started, consider a free trial copy of Wondershare Filmora

##### Step1 Import Media

Hit the "Import" tab to load your songs from ripped CDs or downloaded from the internet.

Then drag and drop your image in a format like JPEG, JPG, JPE, GIF, BMP, DIB, PNG, JFIF, TIFF, TIF to the media library panel. Now you'll consider using all the imported files displayed as thumbnails in the Media library.

##### Step2 Drag and Drop to add photos to audio

Drag songs and photos from the Media Library to the Timeline accordingly.

Filmora assists you in adding various photos to the audio. You can highlight the image and hover your mouse to the last section.

Click the "set duration" icon on the toolbar and set it to fit your music file's length.

Tips: You can zoom-out or zoom-in on the Timeline in the top right corner by dragging the timeline slider to find the ideal position easily.

Check the effect in the preview window after this. If possible, you can ramp up your creation, e.g., add captions, apply special effects, transitions, and even create a picture-in-picture effect.

##### Step3 Save Music with Photos

When you're satisfied with the outcomes, hit the Export tab.

Then, select MP4 under the format tab in the output window, or if you want to play the media on your phone, you can choose the device in the Export window and choose target devices among iPad, iPhone, or Apple TV, etc. Filmora will create a proper setting for phone device saving.

### Bonus tips

Rip audio from video: If you wish to extract audio from a movie trailer, film, comedy, TV show, etc., highlight the video file in the Timeline tab, right-click it and choose the "Audio Detach” tab, then you can eliminate the original video stream and save in a new MP3 format, and now you can freely add your images to the ripped music.

Or, you can delete the original audio file and add a new one.
