There are lots of programs made to split audio tracks. If you are looking for the best free apps for the Mac, then you are on the right page. Below are the top audio splitters for Mac users.

## Part 1\. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create.

 Video reverse is undoubtedly a fantastic way to demonstrate a scene in an interesting way. Filmed normally and then played backwards, this kind of videos can sometimes produce some amazing visual effects. If you want to know some pretty good videos that are played with video reversal, or backwards as some may call it, and learn from their creativeness so as to create one of your own, then you have certainly come to the right place. The following 5 videos top our list of the best backwards music videos.

## 5 of the Best Backwards music videos

### [1\. Forward by Messe Kopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6jprOZ29wY)

 This video was created by Messe Kopp and it is a perfect example of how backwards video techniques have evolved over recent years. It uses all the things that you would normally see in a backwards video and it really is a great video as well. You will also find that the backwards technique adds a complete new dynamic to the video as well so it really is interesting to watch. On top of this, the song is great and the whole scene works really well so you can already start to see how the backwards technique is becoming more and more prominent in today's industry.

### [2\. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01TL9bUWr6I)

 Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse. On top of this, it also shows the guys jump onto the pillows and the entire scene is reversed. The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.

### [3\. Tongue Tied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x1wjGKHjBI)

 This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.

### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

 This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.

### [5\. Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt50B772Fcg)

 This video was done by a group called Small Feet and it really does have a lot to offer, from start to finish. Even though this video made it to number 5 on the list, doesn't mean that it isn't interesting. It was directed by Oskar Wrango and it uses nature in an attempt to tell the story of the song. This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.

 So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn't mean that they are any less interesting to watch. Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don't you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You'd be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.
