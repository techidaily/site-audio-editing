## Dissecting Sound Forge: An Expert's Guide to Audio Mastery

In the music industry, the audio content version has changed drastically. As a result, music production and marketing are growing faster than ever, and only those with proper, updated tools and skills are capable of surviving in this era.

Choosing an audio editor depends on many factors, such as price range, the purpose of using an editor, and skill level. The best editing program can help you get the best audio finishing - MAGIX Sound Forge.

If you are new to the music industry or a professional searching for an audio editor, this article will help you learn everything about Sound Forge.

## Part 1\. A Quick Verdict of Sound Forge

Sound Forge is one of the best software for professionals, beginners, and enthusiasts due to its simple and essential restoration tools that can help remove unnecessary background noises. However, this music software can remove 70% of the noise, leaving some cracks and pops, but still, users get a lot of improvement in the audio quality.

You can record and extract audio from video files. The customizable toolbars, interfaces, and a wide variety of presets give you a complete audio editing experience with Sound Forge.

The only drawback is that the software cannot handle multiple audio files and plugin effects together in the free version, making it useless for batch processing. However, you can get these features in the paid version.

### Our Recommendations

Due to the advanced features and high scores on G2, we recommend using Audacity. However, other factors always come into play as the audio editing demands and needs change with time. So, **Sound Forge** can be a good option for you as a nomad in the music editing industry.

Most companies (with 50-200 employees and 1M-10M revenue) and the higher education industry in the United States are using Sound Forge.

On the other hand, businesses often use Audacity for marketing purposes, such as making Podcasts. The software can record audio for PowerPoint presentations to help visually impaired employees.
