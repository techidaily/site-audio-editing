Artificial intelligence has given us a lot of new creations in this digital world. Voice cloning is another creation that uses deep-learning algorithms to generate synthetic speech and clone voice that is nearly impossible for any human to recognize between the real and the fake voice.

**Voice cloning** can be used for numerous reasons, such as narrating audiobooks to catch an audience and increase the listening experience. It can be used for making digital videos and dubbing celebrity voices. Moreover, it can be used to help communicate with disabled and visually impaired people.

In this article, we are going to talk about 2 ways to **clone voice** and the steps to produce real-time voice cloning.
