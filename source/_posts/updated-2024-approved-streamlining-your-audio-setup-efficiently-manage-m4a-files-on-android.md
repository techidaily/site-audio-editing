## Part2: Convert M4A to popular Audio formats to enjoy it on your Android phones

M4A is certainly not the best when it comes to compatibility. If you don’t want to waste your time finding a power app that supports playing m4a files on Android devices, a perfect alternative solution is to convert your M4A music files to commonly seen music format, such as MP3 before enjoying it on your portable devices. MP3 is a rather more popular music format that is supported by most default Android players. Here we will show you how to convert M4A to MP3 by using [Filmora audio editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for free. You can download a free version below:

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Step1:** Lauch [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and choose “Full Feature Mode”.

**Step2:** Import your M4A music to the media panel, and then drag to the audio track on the timeline below.

## Part3: About M4A format

Although the M4A is a famous type of audio format, there are still a lot of media players which do not support this kind of audio files. You will need to refer to M4A Player apps that support playing M4A if you want to enjoy it on your Android devices. Another solution to this issue is that you can convert the M4A files to commonly seen audio files with Filmora, such as MP3 which is supported by most, if not all kinds of Android players to enjoy it on your Android phones. Try it now.
