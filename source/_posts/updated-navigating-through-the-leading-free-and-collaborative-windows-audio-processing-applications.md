So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online destinations where you can find a huge number of different glitch effects you can use in all of your projects for free.

## The Best Online Destinations Where You Can Download Glitch Sound Effects for Free

There are so many different types of glitches you can add to your videos, and each of them creates a different impression when paired with a different sound. Experimenting with sounds until you find the one that fits the visuals perfectly is probably the best way to make a glitch effect more realistic. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that offer free glitch sound effects.

#### 1. [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/glitches/)

The sound effects are organized by categories so you can browse through Explosion, Industrial or Nature categories while searching for effects you want to use in your video. The Glitches category contains a huge selection of different glitch sound effects that can be downloaded in either mp3 or wav formats. However, you must first create an account and become a Gold member of the ZapSplat community in order to be able to download these effects.

Besides audio files, you can also find stock photos and videos on this platform, but before you can start downloading files you must first create an account. Moreover, some footage isn’t going to be available unless you choose to purchase a monthly or an annual subscription plan. Most glitch sound effects you can find on Audioblocks, the version of the Storyblocks platform dedicated solely to audio files, last only for a couple of seconds, which means that you can’t really use them for glitch scenes that are longer than that. Even though Audioblocks can be a valuable resource, the sound effects you can find here are only useful for short glitch sequences.

#### 3. [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/dotY21/packs/16933/)

You can search for individual glitches by browsing through tags or you can browse through packs that can contain thirty or more glitch sound effect.

#### 4. [Sounddogs](https://www.sounddogs.com/)

This is one of the oldest sound libraries on the Internet that went online in 1997\. Today, Sounddogs offers more than half a million of sound files to its registered users. However, each effect that is available in the Glitches subcategory of the Sound Design category must be purchased and their prices vary from $1,5 to $6,5\. You can listen to each glitch sound effect and decide if it is a good fit for the project you’re working on. This platform can be quite useful if you are in need of a professionally recorded sound effect that matches the glitch visual effects you add to your videos.
