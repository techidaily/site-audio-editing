Let’s explore!

## How Background Music Matters?

![music-studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-studio.jpg)

Well, let’s suppose a hypothetical situation in this case. Imagine a world without sounds or music, and on the other hand, you live in a world that has music everywhere! Which one would you actually prefer to live in?

Likewise, foreground or background music for videos plays a vital role. It is a key ingredient to draw the attention of your viewers that may eventually convert into likes or subscribes or purchases. Incorporating background music in YouTube videos or private videos is an excellent way to create engaging and compelling content.

Here’s a quick fact for you!

Do you know? _“13 hours of video content is published every single minute over the renowned YouTube platform!”_ And a huge chunk of these endearing videos generates a powerful impression on entertained viewers only because of the incorporated catchy background music.

## Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music

Now that you’ve understood that how best background music for videos matters, Step one’s complete. It’s time to move to Step two, i.e. opting for the most appropriate background music for your videos. It seems to be a simpler task but is actually a lot harder.

### How to opt for perfect background music for videos?

Now the questions crop up, how you can choose the perfect background music for videos?

Let’s again take a hypothetical situation. You wish to paint a wall of your home to serve as an accent. Now, you simply don’t just rush to the Home Depot and start to browse every paint swatch available, right?

Since there are a million colors and shades available that will simply make you baffled. Eventually, it may take up forever to decide the final one. Instead, what you should actually do is narrow down your search by first deciding the color that you wish to get the accent wall painted with. After that, you then move on to opt for the appropriate shade.

Likewise, the same principle applies to filter out the background music for your videos. First, you need to understand the occasion that you’re making the video for. Then, you can actually focus on the most suitable beats for your video.

### Understanding the occasion

Now, let’s talk about ‘how would you understand what music is appropriate for the occasion?

Well, that entirely depends on the mood and occasion for which the video is being created.

Here we have listed some of the vital questions that you must ask yourself when it comes down to understanding the mood and occasion before you begin to opt for the best background music for your video.

* What is the theme/occasion/topic of your video?
* What sort of emotions do you wish your viewers must feel while watching your video?
* What is the preferred role of the music in your video? Do you want your music to be in the background or at the forefront?
* Most of all, understand your audience. Do some research about what music type they most probably respond to?

Since the answers can vary depending upon the occasion and the targeted audience. We just can’t answer these for you but yes, we have listed both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos in the latter part of the article.

Before we move on to that, let’s first get to know the ideal way to incorporate background music in your videos without any hassles.

## How to Add Background Music to Video with Filmora

Speaking of adding free background music in [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), we all look for a better and professional tool that can be of great help and provide a finished output. And to look for the one that possesses suitable features as well as leaves the audience wow can be hard for many people.

However, gaining a pro experience in a less complicated manner has become easy with a promising tool namely [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This does exactly what your video desires for editing. And hence, here we are going to explain how to add the best background music to videos.

### Step 1: Download Filmora and install it

First things first, head to the official website of Filmora and then download your copy of it. Install it and launch the tool afterward.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Step 2: Import your original videos

Now, from the main screen of Filmora, you need to hit on the "Import" drop-down menu available on the left top corner. Now, opt for the “Import Media Files…” option to import the video files from the hard disk storage of your computer to the User's album. Once added, you can access all the imported video clips from the left media pane.

Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the required video files to the Filmora interface window from your PC.

Note: If you wish to add images to the User’s album, you can still get it done with the Import function.

![1-import-tutorial-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-import-tutorial-video.jpg)

### Step 3: Download the preferred background music for videos

Now that the videos have been imported, it’s now time to download and import the preferred background music for videos to the Filmora interface.

We have mentioned an entire list of both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos right below this section. You can either get the music from there or if you have already downloaded the music already, get it imported to the Filmora interface and proceed to the next step.

**Note:** Apart from several features that Filmora offers, one notable benefit is that there is a huge collection of royalty-free audio libraries. This library includes background music and sound effects for different moods/genres.

So, just in case you’re not a pro and can’t find and download music from websites.

Simply, get into the Audio Library of Filmora and then, opt for the desired music by tapping over the thumbnail in the media pane. To use the music, just drag and drop the required background music to the track in the timeline pane.

### Step 4: Add video to the timeline track

![drag-music-onto-timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-music-onto-timeline.jpg)

Next, you need to drag the imported video available in the User’s Album to the Timeline track. Once you have the video placed in the timeline, proceed with dragging and dropping the required background music for your video to the track above the video track.

Note: If you’re adding multiple videos to the timeline track, ensure to arrange them according to the play order and without overlapping.

Just in case the length of the background music is greater than that of your video track, you can trim the music track down and adjust its position to match up with your video length. Also, you can do a real-time check while setting up the position in the previewing window to fine-tune your setting.

### Pro Tip for Editing Audio

When it comes to editing audio/background music, you simply need to double-tap over the music track in the timeline to crop up the audio editing panel. Here, you not just can edit your audio/background music but also can add effects like fade in/fade out, tune the pitch, adjust volume, set up Audio Equalizer, etc.

Moreover, with Filmora, you’re also enabled to change the audio speed separately in order to create slow-motion or a fast-forward effect. On top of that, you can even apply the reverse speed effect to playback the music track in reverse.

### Step 5: Export your video with a music file

![export-music-with-video-step](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-music-with-video-step.jpg)

Once you have everything in place and are satisfied with your settings and the result, it’s time to process the video and export it over your computer storage. For this, hit the "Export" option, and then from the appearing pop-up window, opt for the desired file format, hit “OK” afterward to begin with exporting your video.

So, let’s raise the bar with this trendsetting tool.

Let’s explore!

## How Background Music Matters?

![music-studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-studio.jpg)

Well, let’s suppose a hypothetical situation in this case. Imagine a world without sounds or music, and on the other hand, you live in a world that has music everywhere! Which one would you actually prefer to live in?

Likewise, foreground or background music for videos plays a vital role. It is a key ingredient to draw the attention of your viewers that may eventually convert into likes or subscribes or purchases. Incorporating background music in YouTube videos or private videos is an excellent way to create engaging and compelling content.

Here’s a quick fact for you!

Do you know? _“13 hours of video content is published every single minute over the renowned YouTube platform!”_ And a huge chunk of these endearing videos generates a powerful impression on entertained viewers only because of the incorporated catchy background music.

## Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music

Now that you’ve understood that how best background music for videos matters, Step one’s complete. It’s time to move to Step two, i.e. opting for the most appropriate background music for your videos. It seems to be a simpler task but is actually a lot harder.

### How to opt for perfect background music for videos?

Now the questions crop up, how you can choose the perfect background music for videos?

Let’s again take a hypothetical situation. You wish to paint a wall of your home to serve as an accent. Now, you simply don’t just rush to the Home Depot and start to browse every paint swatch available, right?

Since there are a million colors and shades available that will simply make you baffled. Eventually, it may take up forever to decide the final one. Instead, what you should actually do is narrow down your search by first deciding the color that you wish to get the accent wall painted with. After that, you then move on to opt for the appropriate shade.

Likewise, the same principle applies to filter out the background music for your videos. First, you need to understand the occasion that you’re making the video for. Then, you can actually focus on the most suitable beats for your video.

### Understanding the occasion

Now, let’s talk about ‘how would you understand what music is appropriate for the occasion?

Well, that entirely depends on the mood and occasion for which the video is being created.

Here we have listed some of the vital questions that you must ask yourself when it comes down to understanding the mood and occasion before you begin to opt for the best background music for your video.

* What is the theme/occasion/topic of your video?
* What sort of emotions do you wish your viewers must feel while watching your video?
* What is the preferred role of the music in your video? Do you want your music to be in the background or at the forefront?
* Most of all, understand your audience. Do some research about what music type they most probably respond to?

Since the answers can vary depending upon the occasion and the targeted audience. We just can’t answer these for you but yes, we have listed both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos in the latter part of the article.

Before we move on to that, let’s first get to know the ideal way to incorporate background music in your videos without any hassles.

## How to Add Background Music to Video with Filmora

Speaking of adding free background music in [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), we all look for a better and professional tool that can be of great help and provide a finished output. And to look for the one that possesses suitable features as well as leaves the audience wow can be hard for many people.

However, gaining a pro experience in a less complicated manner has become easy with a promising tool namely [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This does exactly what your video desires for editing. And hence, here we are going to explain how to add the best background music to videos.

### Step 1: Download Filmora and install it

First things first, head to the official website of Filmora and then download your copy of it. Install it and launch the tool afterward.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Step 2: Import your original videos

Now, from the main screen of Filmora, you need to hit on the "Import" drop-down menu available on the left top corner. Now, opt for the “Import Media Files…” option to import the video files from the hard disk storage of your computer to the User's album. Once added, you can access all the imported video clips from the left media pane.

Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the required video files to the Filmora interface window from your PC.

Note: If you wish to add images to the User’s album, you can still get it done with the Import function.

![1-import-tutorial-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-import-tutorial-video.jpg)

### Step 3: Download the preferred background music for videos

Now that the videos have been imported, it’s now time to download and import the preferred background music for videos to the Filmora interface.

We have mentioned an entire list of both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos right below this section. You can either get the music from there or if you have already downloaded the music already, get it imported to the Filmora interface and proceed to the next step.

**Note:** Apart from several features that Filmora offers, one notable benefit is that there is a huge collection of royalty-free audio libraries. This library includes background music and sound effects for different moods/genres.

So, just in case you’re not a pro and can’t find and download music from websites.

Simply, get into the Audio Library of Filmora and then, opt for the desired music by tapping over the thumbnail in the media pane. To use the music, just drag and drop the required background music to the track in the timeline pane.

### Step 4: Add video to the timeline track

![drag-music-onto-timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-music-onto-timeline.jpg)

Next, you need to drag the imported video available in the User’s Album to the Timeline track. Once you have the video placed in the timeline, proceed with dragging and dropping the required background music for your video to the track above the video track.

Note: If you’re adding multiple videos to the timeline track, ensure to arrange them according to the play order and without overlapping.

Just in case the length of the background music is greater than that of your video track, you can trim the music track down and adjust its position to match up with your video length. Also, you can do a real-time check while setting up the position in the previewing window to fine-tune your setting.

### Pro Tip for Editing Audio

When it comes to editing audio/background music, you simply need to double-tap over the music track in the timeline to crop up the audio editing panel. Here, you not just can edit your audio/background music but also can add effects like fade in/fade out, tune the pitch, adjust volume, set up Audio Equalizer, etc.

Moreover, with Filmora, you’re also enabled to change the audio speed separately in order to create slow-motion or a fast-forward effect. On top of that, you can even apply the reverse speed effect to playback the music track in reverse.

### Step 5: Export your video with a music file

![export-music-with-video-step](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-music-with-video-step.jpg)

Once you have everything in place and are satisfied with your settings and the result, it’s time to process the video and export it over your computer storage. For this, hit the "Export" option, and then from the appearing pop-up window, opt for the desired file format, hit “OK” afterward to begin with exporting your video.

So, let’s raise the bar with this trendsetting tool.

Let’s explore!

## How Background Music Matters?

![music-studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-studio.jpg)

Well, let’s suppose a hypothetical situation in this case. Imagine a world without sounds or music, and on the other hand, you live in a world that has music everywhere! Which one would you actually prefer to live in?

Likewise, foreground or background music for videos plays a vital role. It is a key ingredient to draw the attention of your viewers that may eventually convert into likes or subscribes or purchases. Incorporating background music in YouTube videos or private videos is an excellent way to create engaging and compelling content.

Here’s a quick fact for you!

Do you know? _“13 hours of video content is published every single minute over the renowned YouTube platform!”_ And a huge chunk of these endearing videos generates a powerful impression on entertained viewers only because of the incorporated catchy background music.

## Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music

Now that you’ve understood that how best background music for videos matters, Step one’s complete. It’s time to move to Step two, i.e. opting for the most appropriate background music for your videos. It seems to be a simpler task but is actually a lot harder.

### How to opt for perfect background music for videos?

Now the questions crop up, how you can choose the perfect background music for videos?

Let’s again take a hypothetical situation. You wish to paint a wall of your home to serve as an accent. Now, you simply don’t just rush to the Home Depot and start to browse every paint swatch available, right?

Since there are a million colors and shades available that will simply make you baffled. Eventually, it may take up forever to decide the final one. Instead, what you should actually do is narrow down your search by first deciding the color that you wish to get the accent wall painted with. After that, you then move on to opt for the appropriate shade.

Likewise, the same principle applies to filter out the background music for your videos. First, you need to understand the occasion that you’re making the video for. Then, you can actually focus on the most suitable beats for your video.

### Understanding the occasion

Now, let’s talk about ‘how would you understand what music is appropriate for the occasion?

Well, that entirely depends on the mood and occasion for which the video is being created.

Here we have listed some of the vital questions that you must ask yourself when it comes down to understanding the mood and occasion before you begin to opt for the best background music for your video.

* What is the theme/occasion/topic of your video?
* What sort of emotions do you wish your viewers must feel while watching your video?
* What is the preferred role of the music in your video? Do you want your music to be in the background or at the forefront?
* Most of all, understand your audience. Do some research about what music type they most probably respond to?

Since the answers can vary depending upon the occasion and the targeted audience. We just can’t answer these for you but yes, we have listed both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos in the latter part of the article.

Before we move on to that, let’s first get to know the ideal way to incorporate background music in your videos without any hassles.

## How to Add Background Music to Video with Filmora

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Step 2: Import your original videos

Now, from the main screen of Filmora, you need to hit on the "Import" drop-down menu available on the left top corner. Now, opt for the “Import Media Files…” option to import the video files from the hard disk storage of your computer to the User's album. Once added, you can access all the imported video clips from the left media pane.

Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the required video files to the Filmora interface window from your PC.

Note: If you wish to add images to the User’s album, you can still get it done with the Import function.

![1-import-tutorial-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-import-tutorial-video.jpg)

### Step 3: Download the preferred background music for videos

Now that the videos have been imported, it’s now time to download and import the preferred background music for videos to the Filmora interface.

We have mentioned an entire list of both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos right below this section. You can either get the music from there or if you have already downloaded the music already, get it imported to the Filmora interface and proceed to the next step.

**Note:** Apart from several features that Filmora offers, one notable benefit is that there is a huge collection of royalty-free audio libraries. This library includes background music and sound effects for different moods/genres.

So, just in case you’re not a pro and can’t find and download music from websites.

Simply, get into the Audio Library of Filmora and then, opt for the desired music by tapping over the thumbnail in the media pane. To use the music, just drag and drop the required background music to the track in the timeline pane.

### Step 4: Add video to the timeline track

![drag-music-onto-timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-music-onto-timeline.jpg)

Next, you need to drag the imported video available in the User’s Album to the Timeline track. Once you have the video placed in the timeline, proceed with dragging and dropping the required background music for your video to the track above the video track.

Note: If you’re adding multiple videos to the timeline track, ensure to arrange them according to the play order and without overlapping.

Just in case the length of the background music is greater than that of your video track, you can trim the music track down and adjust its position to match up with your video length. Also, you can do a real-time check while setting up the position in the previewing window to fine-tune your setting.

### Pro Tip for Editing Audio

When it comes to editing audio/background music, you simply need to double-tap over the music track in the timeline to crop up the audio editing panel. Here, you not just can edit your audio/background music but also can add effects like fade in/fade out, tune the pitch, adjust volume, set up Audio Equalizer, etc.

Moreover, with Filmora, you’re also enabled to change the audio speed separately in order to create slow-motion or a fast-forward effect. On top of that, you can even apply the reverse speed effect to playback the music track in reverse.

### Step 5: Export your video with a music file

![export-music-with-video-step](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-music-with-video-step.jpg)

Once you have everything in place and are satisfied with your settings and the result, it’s time to process the video and export it over your computer storage. For this, hit the "Export" option, and then from the appearing pop-up window, opt for the desired file format, hit “OK” afterward to begin with exporting your video.

So, let’s raise the bar with this trendsetting tool.

Let’s explore!

## How Background Music Matters?

![music-studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-studio.jpg)

Well, let’s suppose a hypothetical situation in this case. Imagine a world without sounds or music, and on the other hand, you live in a world that has music everywhere! Which one would you actually prefer to live in?

Likewise, foreground or background music for videos plays a vital role. It is a key ingredient to draw the attention of your viewers that may eventually convert into likes or subscribes or purchases. Incorporating background music in YouTube videos or private videos is an excellent way to create engaging and compelling content.

Here’s a quick fact for you!

Do you know? _“13 hours of video content is published every single minute over the renowned YouTube platform!”_ And a huge chunk of these endearing videos generates a powerful impression on entertained viewers only because of the incorporated catchy background music.

## Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music

Now that you’ve understood that how best background music for videos matters, Step one’s complete. It’s time to move to Step two, i.e. opting for the most appropriate background music for your videos. It seems to be a simpler task but is actually a lot harder.

### How to opt for perfect background music for videos?

Now the questions crop up, how you can choose the perfect background music for videos?

Let’s again take a hypothetical situation. You wish to paint a wall of your home to serve as an accent. Now, you simply don’t just rush to the Home Depot and start to browse every paint swatch available, right?

Since there are a million colors and shades available that will simply make you baffled. Eventually, it may take up forever to decide the final one. Instead, what you should actually do is narrow down your search by first deciding the color that you wish to get the accent wall painted with. After that, you then move on to opt for the appropriate shade.

Likewise, the same principle applies to filter out the background music for your videos. First, you need to understand the occasion that you’re making the video for. Then, you can actually focus on the most suitable beats for your video.

### Understanding the occasion

Now, let’s talk about ‘how would you understand what music is appropriate for the occasion?

Well, that entirely depends on the mood and occasion for which the video is being created.

Here we have listed some of the vital questions that you must ask yourself when it comes down to understanding the mood and occasion before you begin to opt for the best background music for your video.

* What is the theme/occasion/topic of your video?
* What sort of emotions do you wish your viewers must feel while watching your video?
* What is the preferred role of the music in your video? Do you want your music to be in the background or at the forefront?
* Most of all, understand your audience. Do some research about what music type they most probably respond to?

Since the answers can vary depending upon the occasion and the targeted audience. We just can’t answer these for you but yes, we have listed both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos in the latter part of the article.

Before we move on to that, let’s first get to know the ideal way to incorporate background music in your videos without any hassles.

## How to Add Background Music to Video with Filmora

And to look for the one that possesses suitable features as well as leaves the audience wow can be hard for many people.

This does exactly what your video desires for editing. And hence, here we are going to explain how to add the best background music to videos.

### Step 1: Download Filmora and install it

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Step 2: Import your original videos

Now, from the main screen of Filmora, you need to hit on the "Import" drop-down menu available on the left top corner. Now, opt for the “Import Media Files…” option to import the video files from the hard disk storage of your computer to the User's album. Once added, you can access all the imported video clips from the left media pane.

Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the required video files to the Filmora interface window from your PC.

Note: If you wish to add images to the User’s album, you can still get it done with the Import function.

![1-import-tutorial-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-import-tutorial-video.jpg)

### Step 3: Download the preferred background music for videos

Now that the videos have been imported, it’s now time to download and import the preferred background music for videos to the Filmora interface.

We have mentioned an entire list of both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos right below this section. You can either get the music from there or if you have already downloaded the music already, get it imported to the Filmora interface and proceed to the next step.

**Note:** Apart from several features that Filmora offers, one notable benefit is that there is a huge collection of royalty-free audio libraries. This library includes background music and sound effects for different moods/genres.

So, just in case you’re not a pro and can’t find and download music from websites.

Simply, get into the Audio Library of Filmora and then, opt for the desired music by tapping over the thumbnail in the media pane. To use the music, just drag and drop the required background music to the track in the timeline pane.

### Step 4: Add video to the timeline track

![drag-music-onto-timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-music-onto-timeline.jpg)

Next, you need to drag the imported video available in the User’s Album to the Timeline track. Once you have the video placed in the timeline, proceed with dragging and dropping the required background music for your video to the track above the video track.

Note: If you’re adding multiple videos to the timeline track, ensure to arrange them according to the play order and without overlapping.

Just in case the length of the background music is greater than that of your video track, you can trim the music track down and adjust its position to match up with your video length. Also, you can do a real-time check while setting up the position in the previewing window to fine-tune your setting.

### Pro Tip for Editing Audio

When it comes to editing audio/background music, you simply need to double-tap over the music track in the timeline to crop up the audio editing panel. Here, you not just can edit your audio/background music but also can add effects like fade in/fade out, tune the pitch, adjust volume, set up Audio Equalizer, etc.

Moreover, with Filmora, you’re also enabled to change the audio speed separately in order to create slow-motion or a fast-forward effect. On top of that, you can even apply the reverse speed effect to playback the music track in reverse.

### Step 5: Export your video with a music file

![export-music-with-video-step](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-music-with-video-step.jpg)

Once you have everything in place and are satisfied with your settings and the result, it’s time to process the video and export it over your computer storage. For this, hit the "Export" option, and then from the appearing pop-up window, opt for the desired file format, hit “OK” afterward to begin with exporting your video.

So, let’s raise the bar with this trendsetting tool.
