Background noise is the unwanted sound present in the background while recording audio. It diminishes the overall sound quality of the audio or video. It is not always possible to make a call or record an audio or video from a silent room. Then the noise was made by working machines like a fan, air conditioner, etc., or people talking. It will make it difficult to hear the recording and concentrate on the topic. Quite annoying, right?
