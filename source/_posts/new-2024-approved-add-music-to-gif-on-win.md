## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.

## Final Verdict

Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.

## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.

## Final Verdict

Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them.

## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.
