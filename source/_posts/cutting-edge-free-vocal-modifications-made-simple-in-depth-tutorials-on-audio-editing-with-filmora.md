## **How To Change Your Voice Using Filmora Version 10.5**

In this article, we will discuss three different methods to change your voice in Filmora.

      1. **[Using Tune-up or Tune Down Option](#a)**
      2. **[Using Equilizer Option](#b)**
      3. **[Using Filmora Audio Effects](#c)**

Let's discuss every method one by one in detail and see how you can easily change your voice in Filmora. First of all, make sure that Filmora version 10.5 is installed in your system. If it isn't already installed, you can visit the official website of Wondershare Filmora and download it from there. If you have an older version of Filmora Installed on your system, then you can update it. The best thing about Filmora is that you can download it for free and use all its features without paying anything. The only drawback here is that the final output of your video will have a watermark on it, which you can easily remove by purchasing Filmora.

### **1\. Using Tune-up or Tune Down Option**

**Step1:** Open Filmora and Import your desired video to filmora by going into a file, then clicking on import, and selecting import media files from there.

**Step4:** Once you have done adjusting the pitch of your voice, click ok to apply changes to your audio.

**Step5:** Once you have selected your desired preset, click the ok button to apply it to your video.

**Step6:** Now listen to your video's audio, and you will notice a considerable difference in the voice of your video.

#### 2\. Remove original audio file (optional)

You can remove the original audio in a pretty easy way if you want. To do this, just right click the video clip on Timeline, and select "Audio Detach". or "Mute" as per your needs. If "Audio Detach" has been selected, you'll find a single audio file appearing in the Music Timeline immediately. Then you can easily delete it.

#### 3\. Add audio to MP4 video

When all files come to place, you can begin to make the audio and video perfectly matched. In the Video Timeline, cut and paste any video clip to rearrange the order, and trim out unwanted portion while keeping the others. (Note: Don't overlap one into another, or you'll split the original file).

Now play your source MP4 video, and drag the audio track to the exact position that you want it to begin. If you just want a short part showing up, pause it when it comes to the right place. Then click the Scissors icon above the Timeline to split it into two parts. Keep what you want, and remove the others by hit "Delete" on the keyboard. Note that you can always click Undo/Redo to control your operation.

#### 4\. Adjust the audio file (optional)

After syncing your music file and MP4 video perfectly, you can further adjust the audio file in the editing panel, like change the playing speed, volume, pitch, etc. To do this, just double click the target MP4 video file and edit it in the pop up window.

#### 5\. Save and share your creation

Check your video in the right previewing window. When you're satisfied, click "Create" to export your new work. This program offers four flexible ways letting you save and share video with ease. In the format tab, you'll find almost all popular formats are available to save on your computer. If you want to share your masterpiece on YouTube, select this option to upload it right away. Even you can burn a DVD disk in minutes to watch it on your home cinema.
