Furthermore, the newly launched features of Filmora X tell us about how easy it is to indulge professionalism online. A useful feature for creating podcasts in Wondershare Filmora is Audio Ducking. By checking the quality while editing your video podcast, you can effectively lower the volume of multiple clips in your style. It is the go-to option if you want to highlight your voice within the video. It is pretty easy to use audio ducking as you are only required to move the slider and adjust the video podcast's background volume as per your needs.

### Conclusion

Thus, now you can apply social media strategies learned from the best ten social media podcasts and make your Podcast as well. It is the correct time to reveal your creative side and start making video podcasts using Filmora X.
