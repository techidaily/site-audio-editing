### 2 Lower volume of the media files

 Double click the target file and the "Editing" Window will appear. Then switch to the "Audio" column, reduce volume by dragging the volume level slider left. Don't worry if you don't get the sound right the first time. You can reset the volume by clicking the "Reset" button. After adjusting the volume, click the play icon to listen to the effect.

 Tip: There are more functions in this column, such as Fade in/fade out, fine tune the pitch, etc. If you want to add more effects, go to “Video” column to rotate, adjust contrast, saturation, brightness, nue and speed of the video.
