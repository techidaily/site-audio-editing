      1. **[Using Tune-up or Tune Down Option](#a)**
      2. **[Using Equilizer Option](#b)**
      3. **[Using Filmora Audio Effects](#c)**

Let's discuss every method one by one in detail and see how you can easily change your voice in Filmora. First of all, make sure that Filmora version 10.5 is installed in your system.

_"Can you explain to us the simple method to execute **audio ducking**?”_

I hope you're already aware of **the audio ducking** feature if you're into video editing or any music industry. The audio ducking is commonly to balance two audios. You can see the very typical application while balancing the background music with the person speaking there. So, the different voices would pop up and needs an adjustment according to the scenario. However, selecting the most straightforward process and genuine video editor is the user's responsibility to get the task done effectively. So, here, we would like to discuss the audio ducking function of **CyberLink PowerDirector** along with a suitable alternative - **Wondershare Filmora**.

## Part 1: How to Use Audio Ducking to Fade Out Music in PowerDirector?

**CyberLink PowerDirector** is a video editing software with impeccable features, including Motion Tracking, Magic Movie Wizard, Encoding, Action Camera Tools, and so on. The **audio ducking** element in PowerDirector has automated the audio adjustment in terms of keyframes.

So, let's consider the below steps to **fade out music** or **fade out audio** in PowerDirector audio ducking!

**Step 1: Import Video**

Open the **CyberLink PowerDirector** application, and import the video into the timeline, as shown below. Then, you can also import the background music you'd like to add to the video.

All you need, is to hit the **OK** button and lend the job to PowerDirector.
