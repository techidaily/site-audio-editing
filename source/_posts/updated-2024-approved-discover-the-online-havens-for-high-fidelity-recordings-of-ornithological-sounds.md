**● Room Acoustics:**

Room acoustics are vital to capturing good recordings. You need a generally larger room to make room acoustics compared to an average size room for better results. Here we emphasize that your sound should have appropriate height, width, and depth. These attributes make the difference in recording high-quality and low-quality sound effects.

The quality of your recordings using acoustics should not be much of a bother, though, because various easy-to-use software eliminates the excess noise in your recordings and make the quality of your recording as good as you would want. This software includes; intrusions prevalence, sixty-cycle hum, and more.

**● Microphone Selection:**

Microphone selection is a crucial component in making sound effects during recording. You use sensitive mics for interior scenes to capture subtle nuances make good audio. Here we preferably recommend hyper-cardioid condenser mics.

Consider also placement and closeness of the microphone as they significantly affect the sound effect recorded concerning the sound source. For close-up shots, use closer microphone placement, but if you desire more room sound, put distance between the mic and the sound source.

You can also use the standard mic technique to directly capture a bird sound effect by picking it on a mick. Most of those tones will work fine, but post-production manipulation can create excellent cinematic quality.
