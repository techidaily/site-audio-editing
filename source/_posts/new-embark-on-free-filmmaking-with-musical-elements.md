![ai vocal remover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/easy-to-use-acapella-extractors-for-beginners-and-pros-11.JPG)

* **Removes Vocals from Audio in One Click** – Easily dub any video without covering the current vocals, which allows you to keep great soundtracks after removing the vocals.
* **Effective Vocal Separation** – With the use of advanced AI algorithms, the AI Vocal Remover isolates vocals with exceptional quality to ensure that the vocals are effectively separated from background music. It does all this without losing audio fidelity.
* **Instant Listening of Results** – You won’t have to export or download the entire video or audio to listen to the results. Filmora allows you to view and listen to the results in the editor on the go.
* **Removes other Audio Elements** – Aside from extracting acapella and removing vocals, Filmora allows you to extract other elements from your audio. Point out the unwanted elements to remove from your soundtrack to achieve better results.
* **Dub Exceptional Videos** – No need to record vocals in different languages and stick them over the original ones. The AI Vocal Remover feature allows you to completely remove the originals so you can import new and fresh ones. This will give you highly professional and clear dubbed videos in a matter of clicks.

### [**How To Use AI Vocal Remover?**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
