##### Pros

Other than the seamless connectivity of AirPods with Apple products, it offers one of the most excellent perks, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). It helps you when you want to focus on anything and want to tune yourself to get yourself out of this world, and then this product can cancel a big amount of noise around you which you can keep ON and OFF according to your need.

All audio control will still work with windows, and it's not compulsory to have an Apple device at another end. For example, clicking on the AirPod will pause and play the music, clicking 2 or 3 times forward and backward, and holding AirPods can switch On and Off the ANC mode.

Audio quality is also a big perk while using AirPods with a PC. The regular AirPods are okay in terms of music experience, but there are 5 stars for AirPods Pro.

Have you ever wondered how your voice would sound if you were a kid? With MagicaCall –Voice Changer App, you easily find out since the app lets you modulate your voice or switch between different voice options during a call. Moreover, you can test how your voice will sound before you make the call so that you can plan your prank perfectly. You can also play sound emoticons like a kiss or a clap while the call is in progress to create a comical effect. There are several subscription options available, and you must select one if you want to have access to all of the app’s features.

### How to modulate a voice during a call?

You will have to take the exact steps to modulate your voice during a call depending on the voice changer application you installed on your device. Most of these applications offer preset voices you can apply with a single tap and let you switch between effects so your representative can sound differently during the same conversation.
