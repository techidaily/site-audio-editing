You also have to adjust the pitch manually, speed and tempo to use the male to female voice changer.

The steps to do that are -

* [Download](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) and install Audacity from their website.
* Open the app, and from the tabs on top of the window, select Effects.
* You will see three options in the drop-down menu - Change Pitch, Change Speed and Change Tempo.
* You will have to manipulate each of these options to get the desired female voice.

### 9. GarageBand

[GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/in/mac/garageband/) is a software available for Apple and Windows users. If you are a musician, this free app can quickly help you meet your music editing needs. You have the option to use the male to female voice changer, but you can do it only within the app for pre-existing audio.

Here’s how you can do it -

* Download and install the app on your computer.
* Select the track whose sound you want to change.
* From the Track Info tab, click on the Edit panel. There you’ll find the Default selector.
* In this selector, click on the Male to Female option.

### Final Thoughts

As you can see, these are the top ten free and paid software that you can use for your male to female voice changer needs. You can even use some of them to create customized voices. Be it pranking someone, hiding your identity on social media or making animated voices for your films - there is some excellent software out there to come to your help.
