### Step 2: Mix audio with build-in Audio Mixer

If you are using a video with audio embedded in it, you’d have to detach the audio track from the video by using the simple edit tools provided to you. Now you need to click the Audio Mixer button or double click on the clip to readjust each track's dBm volume, speed, pitch, and panning. You can also trim the audio or apply further effects of your own liking to the soundtrack. While you are working on the track, you can very well check the timely progress of your work.

**Cons of using the usual professional software:**

However, this professional editing software might not be the most suitable tool for you. There are a number of disadvantages of using them.

Only if you have substantial experience working with computers will you be able to manage and manipulate the tools and achieve intended results. The functions of different built-in instruments and features can appear to be complicated sometimes.
* While working with videos, the usual method is somewhat complex. You’d have to extract the audio from the video file first and then apply that to the editing tools.
* While the work is in progress, checking whether the audio track matches the video is very difficult. To do that, you’d have to wait until the job is done.
