## Part 1 How to add audio to video in Premiere Pro

Some essential pointers for all would-be videographers are:

● Before you add audio to video in Premiere Pro, be ready to see your file size increase to a large extent. If you add a background score of 15MB, your total video file size will increase by the same amount of 15MB. The best way to take care of such a problem is to use additional compression techniques to get a suitable file size.
