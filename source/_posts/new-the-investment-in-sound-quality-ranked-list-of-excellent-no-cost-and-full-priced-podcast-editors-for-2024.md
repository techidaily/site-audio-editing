The scream sound effect, also widely known as the Wilhelm scream sound effect is a stock sound effect of a scream, commonly used in scenarios including a fall, a gunshot, an explosion or similar activities. This is a hugely popular screaming sound effect that has been vividly used across films, TV shows and even cartoons. The first recorded use of this sound effect dates back to 1951, in a film called Distant Dreams.

However, this sound effect got its name from Private Wilhelm, a character in the movie ‘The Charge at Feather River’, on whom this sound effect was used when he got shot by an arrow. The scream sound effect gained major popularity after it was added to the stock sound library of Warner Bros, and is still widely used across the film and television industry and even by content creators on various social media videos.
