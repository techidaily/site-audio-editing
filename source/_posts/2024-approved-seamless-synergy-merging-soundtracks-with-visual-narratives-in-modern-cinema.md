The first is to trim to the 'left of playhead' (cuts before), trim to 'right of playhead' (cuts after), 'split at playhead' (splits the video into two). The final option is to 'split and insert freeze frame.' These options give you a lot of control over the video.

### Video Transitions

You have many transitions ranging from 3D transitions to transitions for text or picture in picture options. Once you've selected the transition, tap on the tick mark at the top right corner to apply the effect.

### Handwriting

This lets you handwrite messages, doodles, and more as a layer on top of your video. It can add a personal and creative flair to the video. When used in conjunction with the animation effects, you can expand the scope of use. You can enrich your videos with detailed and hand-drawn assists.

### Animations

One of the better aspects of the KineMaster app is that you can animate individual elements in your video. Each animation has its layer. There are three types of animation.

For instance, 'in animation' guides how the animation enters. The 'out animation' can be used at the end of a clip or when characters exit. 'Overall animations' are sustained throughout the video. You have the option to customize animations.
