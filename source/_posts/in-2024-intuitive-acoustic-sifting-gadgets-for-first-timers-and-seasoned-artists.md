## Part 2\. How to Change Pitch in Audacity?

Audacity, the audio voice changer, offers a 'Change Pitch' feature with which you can change the pitch of the audio without damaging its tempo. You can separately change the speed. With this feature, you can also adjust and play with the frequency and semitones.

The audio editor also features to estimate the starting pitch; for instance, if A3 is a quiet note, followed by a large and loud note like C4, Audacity will detect C4\. In case both notes have the same volume, Audacity will detect A3\. With Audacity, you also get the 'To' and 'From' controls if you plan to change the pitch manually. To learn more about changing pitch, follow the steps below:

Step 1: For changing pitch in Audacity, start by launching the software. After launching, you can either record the audio or else, from the 'File' section, you can also 'Open’ any file from your device.
