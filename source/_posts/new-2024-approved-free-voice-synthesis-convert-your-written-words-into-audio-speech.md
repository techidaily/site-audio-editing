It is a sort of an investment like your car, so you would definitely want to have something that is enduring and gives you value for money.

There are definitely many free music production software available, but it is always recommended to save a few hundred dollars and get something that you can stick with for a long-term.

Before opting for the paid versions of these music production software for Windows and Mac, it is always better to check the trial version of it and then, go ahead with the purchase only if you are satisfied.
