In some cases, people face failure or don’t get desired results, because they don’t get appropriate audio files for the background. If you are also facing such conditions, you should access the YouTube audio library today.

The YouTube library is a hub where you can find out thousands of audio files in different formats. Here, you can find everything, such as – music, songs, sound effects, etc. No matter what your requirements are. But when it comes to using these audio files in a project, everyone has multiple questions about copyright issues, usage terms, accessibility, and so on. Due to it, they want to know some appropriate tips by which they can understand how to use the library perfectly without creating any mess.

If you are also having such confusion, upcoming tips will help you a lot.

#### In this article

01 [Where Can I Use Music From YouTube Audio Library?](#Part 1)

02 [Check If A Song On YouTube Audio Library Is Copyright Protected?](#Part 2)

03 [Song Modification For Copyright Immunity](#Part 3)

04 [How To Add My Music To YouTube Audio Library?](#Part 4)

05 [Rules Of Official YouTube Audio Library Channel](#Part 5)

## Part 1 Where Can I Use Music From YouTube Audio Library?

Firstly, everyone wants to know how and where they can use the audio files from the YouTube library. Basically, you can find two types of audio files in the library, paid and free. You can find out thousands of options in the free audio tab. But all audio files are not available with similar terms & conditions. Here, the interested ones need to be careful, such as – checking out the attributions and their labels.

If the file is free from all types of attributions and has a sound quality of 320KBPS, you can easily use the YouTube audio library download option and use it as you want. These are some audio files that are out of all types of restrictions and provide an open helping hand to all users. They can also use such audio clips on other social media platforms for making their content impressive and effective. With it, you should respect the guidelines and terms & conditions of the platform as well.

## Part 2 Check If A Song On YouTube Audio Library Is Copyright Protected?

As we discussed earlier, the YouTuber library has numerous songs free from copyright-related issues or hurdles. Due to it, anyone can easily use them in any video and proceed further. On the other hand, you cannot ignore the fact of having some copyright-protected audio files as well. In case you use a copyright-protected file in your video without the permission of the real owner or publisher, it will lead to legal actions or claim procedures.

Here, you may also find some YouTube audio library music files with copyright restrictions but are free to use in some considerations. Generally, these conditions are providing credit to the copyright holder in the video description and some other factors. It is the main reason why everyone should consider proper copyright check up before using any audio from the YouTube library. One careless step can lead to several problems.

![Copyright Protected](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ytb-downloader-2.png)

## Part 3 Song Modification For Copyright Immunity

According to some individuals, copyright and related actions take place because of identical similarities between the two files. Due to this, they think if they modify some parts of audio by making changes in pitch, tempo, and some other technical changes, they can use it without any problem. This technique might appear useful for some individuals while using a common thing.

If someone detects such a kind of modification or violation of copyright policy, you may face some strict actions too. According to the YouTube Library rules, you can modify or use a copyrighted audio file by taking permission from the copyright holder only. In case you do something without having permission, it will be considered an illegal act and a violation of platform policy. The copyright holder can also take action as he or she wants. It will be good if you choose the files that are available with YouTube audio library free download options only.
