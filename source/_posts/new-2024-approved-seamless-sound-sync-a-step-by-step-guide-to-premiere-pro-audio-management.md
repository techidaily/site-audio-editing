If you are the type of person who loves mixing audio, then you’ll need to use this little-known function in Adobe Premiere Pro. While you might know about the Audio Clip Mixer, which lets you take on the audio between clips, the Audio Track Mixer allows you to control a whole track, which can be beneficial in its own way. Sometimes you need to make big sweeping changes that affect everything, and no one wants to change their all sounds clip by clip, which is where the track mixer comes in handy.

So how do you use the audio track mixer to manage your audio inside of a video? Well keep reading and we’ll show you!

* [**Part 1: How Does the Audio Track Mixer Work**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How to Change the Audio Track Mixer Settings**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Using Audio Track Mixer for Your next Project**](#part3)

## Part 1: How Does the Audio Track Mixer Work

Mixing tracks is when audio is blended and mixed together in a sequence, and you have multiple sounds over one channel. For instance, when you watch a TV show and have music cut over two characters talking, that’s an example of mixed tracks. You can mix music, dialogue, sound effects, voiceovers, and other things to create a seamless finished product. You can even have different types of audio, or have different tracks play in different earphones of the headset if you want to.

![Audio Track Mixer overview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-track-mixer-overview.jpg)

With audio track mixer, you can see each track being played in real time, not just on the timeline but also on its own screen. Then you can do a few things to each track such as:

* listen to tracks separately or together
* rename them
* control the volume and type of audio that each track is producing

![Audio Track Mixer details](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-track-mixer-detailes.jpg)

You can even look at meters while the main window is closed, which is helpful if you need to free up some space or organize your sounds while other data is shown.

You can see the sequence in real time as it is being played, see the peaks and valleys of the sound, and ensure that you can control the volume for every track. You’ll have total control over the sound, and the playback.

## Part 2: How to Change the Audio Track Mixer Settings

If you are the type of person that likes to work with the sound as it happens, then you can. Recording and mixing on the fly is easy if [you can avoid some mistakes](https://www.audio-issues.com/music-mixing/mixing-mistakes-top-ten/).

Using mono tracks allows you to alter the sound for left and right settings, while stereo tracks produce two different signals for two different speakers. So, if you want to control where the sounds are coming from, then you can do so with a simple adjustment.

![ Audio Track Mixer Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-track-mixer-settings.jpg)

The audio files are edited both in the audio interface and in a timeline, where it is either imported or directly recorded. Then their waveforms can be viewed, the volume and sounds can be adjusted, and [larger audio mixes can be divided into sub-mixes](https://www.izotope.com/en/blog/mixing/5-approaches-to-submixes.html).

All your changes will happen on the timeline, and you’ll be able to listen to the new track instantly.

## Part 3: Using Audio Track Mixer for Your next Project

If you are an aspiring filmmaker, working on a project, or just putting some clips and music together for fun, you need to use Audio Track Mixer to gain control over your sounds. Dealing with tracks, especially when you have several of them running on top of one another, can be a frustrating process of clicking and straining your ears to ensure that everything is just perfect.

Instead of wasting hours staring at the computer screen, using the Audio Track Mixer in Premiere Pro is a great way to cut down on the micromanagement and instead focus on what’s really important - getting a good quality sound out of your video and audio.

Use the track mixer to manage and customize your sounds, see the volume and base of each individual track in real time, and set when tracks come in and fade out. Using the mixer will allow you to have picture perfect sound quality, every single time.

## Conclusion

If you want to edit audio in an easier way, here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is a video editor designed for people who want to enter a higher level of video editing. You can use FilmoraPro to do automatic audio sync.

## Part 1: How to Add Background Music to Video

In the content below, we will show you the detailed steps of adding background music or sound effect with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Besides adding music, users can also cut and edit audio easily at the same time.

### **Step 1**: Import your original videos

Click the "Import" option to load the video files from your computer hard disk to the User's album. Alternatively, simply drag and drop these videos from your computer to the primary window. All the added video clips will be displayed in the left media pane. Note that you can add still images files if needed.

![add music to youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-9.jpg)

### **Step 2**: Add background music to the video

Drag the imported video files from the album to the tracks on the Timeline one by one. Make sure that they are arranged according to the play order and without overlapping. Then drag and drop the music files to the track above the video track. Now you can trim it and adjust the position to fit for your video length. When you set the position, you can check the previewing window and fine-tune it in real-time.

One of the benefits of using background music with Filmora is that there is a royalty-free Audio library that provides different genres of background music and sound effects. So, if you don’t want to find and download music from websites, just check the Audio Library in Filmora. Click the music thumbnail in the Media pane, and then drag and drop it to the track in the timeline pane.

![add background music to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-9.jpg)

**Editing audio tips**: Double click the music file in the track to pop up the audio editing panel. Here, you can do more audio edit like add fade-in/fade-out effect, adjust volume, tune the pitch, set up Audio Equalizer, etc. With Filmora, you can also change the audio speed separately to make a fast forward or slow-motion effect or apply reverse speed to playback the audio in reverse.

![put music to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg)

### **Step 3**: Export your video with a music file

When you're satisfied with the result, hit "Export" to export your video. In the pop-up window that appears, choose to save any file format you like.

Besides exporting video on your computer, you can also create a video for devices like the iPhone, iPad, or directly upload the video to YouTube and Vimeo, or burn to DVD for playing on TV. All can be achieved with this all-in-one video editor, no extra software required. If you want to loop background music, you just need to drag the background music clip to the same length of the video clip. So easy to do it!
