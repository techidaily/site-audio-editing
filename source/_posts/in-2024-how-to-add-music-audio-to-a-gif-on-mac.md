Currently, there are over 29 million podcast episodes in over a hundred languages on the Internet, which shows how much competition you will be facing once you start a new podcast. That is why it is so important to optimize each new episode of your podcast for Google’s ever-changing algorithm. Adding tags, metadata, or writing a description of the podcast are just a few ways to improve the visibility of the content you share online.

**Transcribing podcasts** on your own becomes increasingly difficult as their duration increases.
