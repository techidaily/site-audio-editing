## Step-by-Step Guide to Saving Your Google Voice Chat on Device and PC

Many people think that the call-recording feature is only helpful to deal with stalkers and obsessive exes. However, there are several other reasons as well.

Call recording features help you in numerous ways such as conducting remote interviews, keeping track of verbal agreements, and recording important meetings for later reference. A myriad of applications are available on iPhone and android.

Since most voice recording applications are expensive, Google voice turns out to be one of the best apps to record calls.
