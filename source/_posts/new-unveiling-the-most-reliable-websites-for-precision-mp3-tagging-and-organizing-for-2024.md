### Step 2: Separating Audio from Video

Separate the audio track from the video to work on it specifically. Right-click the video file within the timeline and select "Audio Detach." This action creates a separate audio file that can be edited separately.

### Step 3: Selecting the background noise option

Right-click on the audio track within the timeline and select "Edit." This will open the background noise menu, where you can adjust the audio quality.

First, use the "Denoise" function to reduce background noise. Don't worry if the initial denoising doesn't meet your expectations; there are other options. If you want a strong denoising effect, move the slider to "Strong" or "Mid."

### Step 4: Adjusting your audio

Using the denoise function may result in a little distortion of the voice or other audio elements. To enhance your audio quality, you can also use the "Equalizer" tool above the Denoise function. Enhance sound quality with the Equalizer tool by customizing the audio settings.

Default settings are zero for the equalizer. You should focus on the first four settings on the left side, which control the bass frequencies. Reduce the leftmost setting and adjust the mid-tones to avoid that robotic sound. Right-sidе еqualizеr sеttings, which dеal with high-pitchеd trеblе noisе, don't nееd to bе adjustеd.

### An adverse effect of background noise on audio quality

Background noise distracts and obscures the intended message. The line between important and irrelevant is blurred. The content can be difficult to focus on, understand, and connect with. Sound effects, music, and voices become unclear, causing frustration.

Background noise can undermine content creators' credibility and professional image. Excessive noise signals a need for attention to detail and quality, whether you are an educator, a storyteller, or a business professional. Background noise isn't simply a nuisance, it's a communication barrier.
