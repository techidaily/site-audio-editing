Otter is one of the few dictation softwares that offer high accuracy like the previously mentioned Dragon app of Nuance. This software uses Ambient Voice Intelligence which helps it to learn as the speaker speaks. Some of the features of this app include sync with zoom, sharing voiceprints, etc.

Otter has a speaker identification feature that makes it stand out among other dictation softwares. It is ideal for meetings where will be more than one speaker and, the change of the speaker will be highlighted in the transcribed text.

## How to Choose the Best Dictation Software

All the dictation software mentioned above performs very well for transcribing into text, and some of them have additional features which might be very helpful. The best software for you will depend on the purpose for which you are using it.

For office purposes, the dictation apps of Otter or Dragon might be the best for you. If mailing and preparing documents are your purposes then Speechnotes or Braina can do the job. If you don’t want to spend any money on dictation apps, you can go for the free ones like Google Voice Docs typing.
