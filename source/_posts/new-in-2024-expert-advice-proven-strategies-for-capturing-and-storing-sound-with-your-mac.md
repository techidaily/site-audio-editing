You can slow down songs quickly from your mobile phone. ‘[Music Speed Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smp.musicspeed&hl=en&gl=US)’ is an application that you can download on your mobile and use to slow down your desired music. You can change the song's speed from 15% to 500% of the original speed. The application also offers an ‘Equalizer.’ Importantly, it supports a wide variety of audio file formats.

The application also has a built-in audio recorder. Music Speed Changer has a modern designed UI, but it is very easy to use. Let us help you a little by sharing its guideline with you.

Step 1: You can start by installing the application and opening it. After that, you have to locate and open the music file that you want to work with.

Step 2: Once that is done, you will see an upward arrow in the bottom left corner; hit that. It will open a new screen where you will see the option of 'Tempo.'

Step 3: Now, you can slide the ‘Tempo’ to the left side to reduce the speed, which will eventually slow down music. Lastly, hit the three vertical dots from the top right corner and select the option ‘Save Edited Track’ to save the new music file.
