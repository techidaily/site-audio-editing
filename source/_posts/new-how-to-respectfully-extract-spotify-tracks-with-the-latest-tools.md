Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.

Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.

![podcast directory youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-2.jpg)

Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create video-based podcasts seamlessly.

### 2\. [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)

"Glad I waited a while to find a podcast website provider. Starting from scratch in WordPress seemed too much hassle. Luckily the site came along while I was dithering about what to do.

The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I'm delighted to have chosen this option. Already, my pod site feels "complete" to look at, and more features are coming soon that will help with marketing, understanding listeners, and building a podcast brand."
