### 1\. Celebrity Voice Changer – Face

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/celebrity-voice-changer-face/id1111710488) 9.0 or later

**User Rating:** 4.0

In case you would like to sound like your favorite movie star of TV host, then Celebrity Voice Changer is one of the best choices you can make. Besides the standard set of options, the app also lets you request new voices since its machine learning technology can mimic virtually anyone's voice. However, Celebrity Voice Changer is currently only available in English and it cannot modulate speech in other languages. In addition, you must make an in-app purchase in order to gain access to all of the app's features or unlock the unlimited usage of the app.

**Pros**

* Automatic voice modulation
* Huge selection of voice filters
* The app generates video files that are better adjusted to the audience on social media than audio files
* Excellent impressions of celebrities

**Cons**

* Unreasonably expensive
* The app's Deep Learning technology still has a lot of room for improvement

### 2\. Snapchat

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370) 10.0 or later, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&hl=en) 4.4 or up

**User Rating:** 3.8

With more than 203 million daily users, Snapchat is one of the largest messaging platforms on the market. Previously, we've shared [how to change gender on Snapchat](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), beside that, the app lets its users capture short moments or the so-called Snaps and share them with friends. In addition to hundreds of [video filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Snapchat also features a broad spectrum of voice changing effects that make Snaps more entertaining. Even so, the audio recording options Snapchat offers are far from ideal, because the app doesn't allow you to edit the files you create with it. Using Snapchat will drain your battery quickly, which is why you must pay attention to how frequently you use this app.

**Pros**

* The easy voice modulation process
* Excellent messaging options
* Grants you access to a large community of likeminded people
* Lenses and filters are updated on a daily basis

**Cons**
