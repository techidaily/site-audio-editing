## How to Prepare for Recording a Podcast?

To know how to record a podcast remotely, you must note the initial steps of preparation. And that is going to include content selection to choosing the right recording equipment.

**Plan the content**

The very first step is to plan the content of the podcast. Also, make sure that the topic or niche you will select must be up to your knowledge. It should be a topic for which you can discuss 100+ episodes. Invest the right amount of time in planning the content of the podcast.

**Choose co-host (optional)**

You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.

**Select the format, style, and length of the podcast**

After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.

**Consider Podcast Recording Equipment**

Don't think of investing in a fancy podcast recording studio, especially when you are starting. Professionals even say that the outdoors is useful when you are confident to speak in public. It will also offer a preview of the background hustle, which further looks attractive and engaging to the listener.

You can even start from a phone with a good microphone setup. It’s better to invest in a good-quality microphone and have your little format ready all by itself. Try looking for an audio mixer if you have gone a bit advanced in podcast recording.

**Recording Software**

Tip: If the audio file needs further editing, just double click it on the audio track, and the audio editing panel will pop up. Then you can adjust the volume, set fade in/fade out, tune the pitch and denoise the audio as you like.

#### 3\. Export the file

After aligning the video with the audio on the timeline, hit “Export” to merge them together. You can save it as any file format you like. Besides that, you can also upload the merged video to YouTube directly, or burn to DVD.

#### 2\. Merge Video and Audio

After importing your videos to the media library, you can drag-n-drop the video and audio files to the video and audio track respectively. After that, you can align the video with the audio file on the timeline to merge them. Or if you want to replace the audio in the source video with the new audio file, you can right click the video on the track, select Detach Audio, and the original audio from the video will be detached out to the audio track. Then you can delete the detached audio from the track, add your new audio file to the audio track again, and finally align it with the video.

Tip: If the audio file needs further editing, just double click it on the audio track, and the audio editing panel will pop up. Then you can adjust the volume, set fade in/fade out, tune the pitch and denoise the audio as you like.

#### 3\. Export the file

After aligning the video with the audio on the timeline, hit “Export” to merge them together. You can save it as any file format you like. Besides that, you can also upload the merged video to YouTube directly, or burn to DVD.
