**How to add Sound and Edit your Voiceovers for Podcasts with Filmora?**

Step1 Download and launch the Wondershare Filmora 11 software on your PC or Mac device.

Step2 Plug a stable microphone you will use on the computer when you start. For the best voice quality during recording, it is best to utilize a high-grade external microphone model for professional-level sound capture.

Step3 Access the Filmora software after you launch it beforehand. On the homepage, click on the New Project option.

Step4 When the editor program opens, tap on the drop-down menu below the top-most toolbar for Record. From the options, select the "Record a Voiceover" choice.

![select record a voiceover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/select-record-a-voiceover-in-filmora.jpg)

Step5 The recording pop-up window will open. Click on the big red record button after the input microphone/speaker settings, and start speaking. When you are done, click the square red stop button. Press OK to save.

Alternatively, you can click on the Microphone icon. Please wait 3 seconds and then start speaking into the microphone and click it again after you are done speaking. The newly recorded file will automatically come in the audio track timeline.

Step6 Click the audio track in the timeline. Among the settings, make changes as you prefer in Pitch, Volume, and Speed. Cut the sections of your voiceover recording you want to remove and add fade-in/fade-out effects. After making all changes, click OK.

![after making changes click ok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/change-audio-track-settings.jpg)

Step7 If you have the recording of the narration already available in other locations, like your phone or device, import it into the software.

Step8 Add transitions, effects, and titles from the respective tabs on the top toolbar.

![add titles from the title tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/add-titles.jpg)

Step9 To add sound effects, go to Media and acquire the new audio clip or effect to add. Go to Effects > choose Audio Effects. Download the sound effect you want to insert and drag it onto the clip in the timeline.

![choose audio effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/choose-audio-effects.jpg)
