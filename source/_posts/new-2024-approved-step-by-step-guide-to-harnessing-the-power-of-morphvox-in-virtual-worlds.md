**Step 2**: Under the Effects tab, choose "Noise Reduction" and leave the defaults. Once you've selected a segment, click "Get Noise Profile", and Audacity will determine what to filter out.

**Step 3**: Select the entire audio file that needs to be cleaned up. Select the amount of noise you want to remove again in the Noise Reduction window. The wind noise can be reduced by clicking OK. The default settings can be used.

**Step 4**: Improve the muffling of your audio by going to Effect and Amplify. After removing the noise, you can click "Preview". If yes, the denoised audio can then be exported from Audacity to MP3, WAV, or other formats.

## Part 3\. Remove Wind Noise From Video On iPhone/Android With iMovie App

### [iMovie App for Android and iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

With iMovie, you can edit videos on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad in a simple and intuitive manner. You can use it to create videos with multiple effects, color corrections, stabilisations, and audio enhancements. It is easy for users to create cutaways, use blue/green screens, or apply split screens or picture-in-pictures.

An equalizer and an audio filter are built into the Mac version of iMovie to reduce noise. Make sure your setup does not remove the voice as well. In contrast, the iPhone requires the audio to be detachable or the volume to be reduced.
