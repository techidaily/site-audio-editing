## High-Fidelity Audio Tuning Prescriptions for Modern Devices

When you use your device for listening to music, default audio profile of your device is just not good enough. This is because a default audio profile makes almost all types of music sound similar and you will never get to listen to the variations they have. That is where an equalizer comes into the scene. An equalizer is basically an audio filter or profile that has a certain setting for the frequencies of sound so that the music you are playing on your device sounds as good as originally recorded.

Whether you listen to music on your smartphone or your computer through speakers or headphones, an equalizer app is a necessity especially if you are an audiophile. That is why we have picked the best sound equalizer apps both for smartphones and computers where there are several music equalizer settings available to choose from.

## 1\. Best Chrome Sound Equalizer Settings

The extension comes with 21 preset audio profiles that you can set instantly based on the music genre you are playing. Besides, you can customize the 10-band Equalizer as per your requirements.
