## Part 1: Some Basic Recording-Level Considerations One Should Make to Avoid Noise in Videos

The advancements in AI technology have made noise reduction seamless. Although, there are some pre-recording measures one can take to minimize noise. This section on **reducing background noise in iMovie** will mention those measures. The following primary considerations can make a big difference in terms of noise:

### 1\. Pick the Right Location

If you are recording an audio or video, the first step is to choose the right surroundings. Although no location can be completely noise-free, one can try. Places with less population and more nature are noise-free as usual. Book a studio for video or audio recording, as you don't need much effort. They offer pre-arranged setups and space, which also includes noise-canceling equipment.
