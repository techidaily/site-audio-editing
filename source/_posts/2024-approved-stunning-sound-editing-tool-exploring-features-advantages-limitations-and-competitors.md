### Closing Word

DJ is about discovering party background music for people to groove to. It's not just about the technical mixing and editing of songs. Dropping a fresh track into your set and seeing a crowd respond to that track is priceless. However, finding what music to download and where to find it is a task.

We hope this article will be helpful for DJs looking to build a music library. Be it corporate parties, weddings, intimate get together; they are incomplete without DJ background music. There is nothing more motivating for a DJ than having new tunes to play for the audience. So, get ready to discover places to get new party tunes to swing to.

We hope you have fun building your DJ collection!
