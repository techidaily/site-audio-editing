## How to Prepare for Recording a Podcast?

To know how to record a podcast remotely, you must note the initial steps of preparation. And that is going to include content selection to choosing the right recording equipment.

**Plan the content**

The very first step is to plan the content of the podcast. Also, make sure that the topic or niche you will select must be up to your knowledge. It should be a topic for which you can discuss 100+ episodes. Invest the right amount of time in planning the content of the podcast.

**Choose co-host (optional)**

You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.

**Select the format, style, and length of the podcast**

After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.

**Consider Podcast Recording Equipment**

Don't think of investing in a fancy podcast recording studio, especially when you are starting. Professionals even say that the outdoors is useful when you are confident to speak in public. It will also offer a preview of the background hustle, which further looks attractive and engaging to the listener.

You can even start from a phone with a good microphone setup. It’s better to invest in a good-quality microphone and have your little format ready all by itself. Try looking for an audio mixer if you have gone a bit advanced in podcast recording.

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

![adobe audition set frequency](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-7.jpg)
