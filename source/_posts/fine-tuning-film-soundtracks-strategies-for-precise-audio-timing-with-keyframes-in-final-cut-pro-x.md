Are you familiar with audio keyframing? So, what is this audio keyframing? Does this term appear new for you? It won't anymore as we are here to explain. In the world of animation, knowing about keyframes is more critical. Have you ever noticed certain scenes while watching a movie that would reflect different audio volume in other video clips? It is all because of this process of keyframing that allows you to change the parameter values in a video clip. A keyframe on the clip specifies the start and end of the changes that occur in the frames, images, or drawings.

Filmmaking, hand-drawn animation, and short movies are critical applications where keyframing finds the place, especially in changing positions, scaling subjects, and customizing opacity. Although the concept might seem in-depth and confusing, implementing such keyframes isn't a hassle as you think if you have a handy video editor. Today, let's look at one such software, Final Cut Pro X, which is the popular tool for Mac at present in keyframing. With no delay, scroll down to add and edit **audio keyframes** in FCPX at ease.

## Part 1: How to Add Audio Keyframes in Final Cut Pro X?

So, how to precisely **add the Final Cut Pro keyframes**? This session will reveal the answer as we have given a step-by-step guide.

**Step 1:**  Launch and open the Final Cut Pro X software on your Mac device. Select the video clip in the timeline or select a video from the location.

Now, choose “Clip > Show Audio Animation”, or you can also press **Ctrl + A**.

**Step 2:** You will now see various automation options to change the audio of the clips.

To add keyframes, you have to hold or press option-K to create a keyframe on the horizontal effect control that will result in a white diamond depicting the created keyframes.

**Step 3:** Apart from the Audio Animator tool, you can create a Final Cut Pro **audio keyframe** with the range selection tool. To do so, on the video timeline, you need to sue the **keyframe shortcut Final Cut Pro**, which is to hold down R.

Hold the R key down, and on the timeline, click the spot where you need to begin the keyframing, drag the mouse pointer to the area where the keyframing should end. It will mark a range with a diamond.

That is the way you can add a **fcpx audio keyframe**, and is it easy?

## Part 2: How to Modify Audio Keyframes in Final Cut Pro X?

Now that you have successfully created or added **audio keyframes fcpx**, do you wish to adjust or modify them, like changing the volume or any other enhancements? Yes, Final Cut Pro X offers adjustments. Learn how to do it from here.

**Step 1:** Usually, users follow the same way in the keyframe to change the volume per your requirement on the "Volume and Pan" segment.

You can slide the volume pointer as needed, or from the inverted triangle next to the option, you can choose the "Reset Parameter" option to reset the changes.

**Step 2:** You can configure the Pan option of the keyframe and FCPX that offers multiples ones like stereo left/right, basic surround, create space, and so on.

**Step 3:** To adjust the audio animation editor's keyframes, you can drag the diamond to the left/right to change the keyframe position.

If you want to alter the effect's parameter value, you can drag the keyframe up or down.

There is one more option by which you can edit the **final cut pro audio keyframe.** If you click the "Final Cut Pro" option on the top and choose the editing option, it will show you various options to adjust the keyframes like reference waveforms, transitions, etc.

With access to the in-built options offered by Final Cut Pro X, you can easily adjust the created or added **fcpx audio keyframe** at ease.

## Part 3: FAQs about Audio Keyframing in Final Cut Pro X?

**1\. Will changing the "Show reference waveform" checkbox on the editing window's audio aspect affect the fcpx audio keyframe?**

No. A tick over the "Shoe reference waveforms" checkbox will only make changes over the timeline waveform representation. However, no change will occur on the keyframe unless the duration or still images get altered.

**2\. Can I add keyframes across a selected area automatically?**

Yes, with the Range Selection tool's assistance, you can add keyframes over a selected range automatically. To do so, execute the "Clip > Audio Animation > select an effect > disclosure button." From the tools pop-up menu with the mouse icon, choose the option, "Range Selection."

**3\. Despite Audio animation, is there any other option to adjust the fcpx keyframe?**

Yes. To access many different effects in the Final Cut Pro X software, you can change the parameter values of sole keyframes using Audio Inspector.

**4\. Is viewing a single effect at a time in the Audio Animation editor is possible in FCPX?**

Yes. If you have applied multiple effects to a clip and need to preserve a screen space, you can collapse the Audio Animation editor to view one impact at a time. Tapping the "Solo Animation" option from the Click Menu can execute this task.

**5\. Can I delete the created Final Cut Pro audio keyframe?**

Sure. To delete an audio keyframe, select the keyframe, and press the “Shift + Delete” option. Now, navigate to the Audio Inspector, and hit the “Keyframe” button.

## Conclusion

I am sure you are excited to know that working with **the Final Cut Pro keyframe** is easier than you have imagined. Yes, it is, and I hope with the ultimate guide on how to **add keyframe Final Cut Pro X** along with specific FAQs regarding **fcpx audio keyframe**, we have put a full-stop to your queries.

As we have mentioned earlier, noise removal damages the overall quality of the audio. All your effort goes to waste if your voice is not clear or anything else. Now that you know how you can handle background noise removal, it’s time to talk about something new and different.

The following section of this article is going to share tips and tricks that could be adopted. These will help you to get better and improved quality while editing audio.

### 1\. Restore Bass

The first tip that we are going to introduce is restoring the bass of the media file. You can do this by using the Parametric Equalizer and dragging it onto the timeline. With an equalizer, you can play with different audio frequencies. Whatsoever suits the best, you can set it.

### 2\. Atmosphere Setting

Its essential to first of all create an atmosphere. For this, you can mix sounds, add reverb and even adjust the loudness. An ambiance audio tag can be used for background noise. You need to set the scene for your music or the dialogue.

### 3\. Compress the Audio

To make the audio better and more consistent, it is essential to compress it. Like the name is presenting, compression lowers the volume of loud parts, increases the volume of fairly quiet parts, it compresses the waveform of audio. After compression, your audio sounds instantly better, especially the voices.

### 4\. Dialogue Adjustments

You can unify different recordings for a common loudness if you tag audio clips as Dialogue. If you plan to add a voiceover to your video, then you must improve the clarity, reduce or remove any background noise and also, adjust the reverb. Subtitles could be added to make the conversation understandable in your video.

### 5\. Remove Noise
