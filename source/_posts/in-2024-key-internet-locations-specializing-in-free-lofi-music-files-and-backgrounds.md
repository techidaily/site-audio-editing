* Offers 10 hours of automatic post-production each month

**Cons**

* The free version of Zencastr offers only limited capabilities
* Sharing an audio file recorded with Zencastr directly to a podcast hosting platform is not possible

### 7\. [Alitu](https://alitu.com/)

**Price:**  $28,00 billed monthly or $280 billed annually

**Compatibility:** web-based

This online platform simplifies the process of creating a podcast by offering automatic audio editing services. You just have to upload the files you would like to edit and the Alitu is going to improve their quality.

The app’s theme maker lets you create soundtracks for your podcasts, while the id3 tags are added automatically to each audio file you process with Alitu. In addition, you can create a solo recording from the app, and post them on Podbean, Libsyn, Blubrry and other podcast hosting platforms. Even so, Alitu’s automatic audio editing features are not powerful enough to compete with more advanced and more affordable podcast recording software products. The app’s selection of [audio filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and plugins is also quite limited, especially when its price is considered.

**Pros**

* The short and simple podcast production process
* Support for a broad spectrum of audio file formats
* Uploading podcasts directly to Libsyn, Buzzsprout or any other podcast hosting platform is easy
* Excellent noise removal capabilities

### 8\. [ProTools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools#Choose-your-version)

**Price:**  Pricing plans start at $29,99 per month

This is probably one of the oldest DAW software products on the market, and certainly one of the best. ProTools is a professional audio recording and editing software that offers all features you can need while recording a new episode of your podcast.

[Mixing multiple tracks](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or adding effects to your recordings are only a few out among the countless options you are going to have at your disposal if you choose to make your podcasts with ProTools. Furthermore, you’ll be able to collaborate with other members of your team through the cloud or share your work via the [Avid Link](https://www.avid.com/products/avid-link) app. The audio recording features ProTools offers can be overwhelming for newcomers to the world of podcasts, so if you don’t have previous audio recording experience it is better to opt for a less demanding podcast recording software.

### 9\. [Ringr](https://www.ringr.com/)

**Price:**  Pricing plans start at $7,99 per month

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, web-based

Conducting remote interviews with Ringr is easy, as you just have to schedule the interview and then connect via the Ringr app. As soon as the conversation starts, Ringer will start recording it and once the conversation is finished the audio file will be automatically uploaded to the Ringr platform.

The app will then merge the files it created for each participant of the conversation to improve the audio’s quality, although all recordings created with the Basic subscription plan are going to be saved as Mono MP3 files. Once the automatic audio editing process is completed you can proceed to download the conversation you recorded, but keep in mind that the Conference Calling options are only available if you choose a Premium or Enterprise, subscription models.

**Pros**

* Enables podcasters to conduct remote interviews
* Efficient call scheduling tools
* The number of calls you can make with Ringr isn’t limited
* Quick download process

**Cons**

* The quality of the recording depends on the pricing plan you purchase
* No audio editing tools

### 10\. [ecamm Call Recorder for Skype](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/)

**Price:**  $39,95

**Compatibility:** macOS

ecamm Call Recorder for Skype is not a podcast recording software product, as it is primarily used as a tool that [records Skype conversations](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Podcasters who often conduct interviews through Skype can rely on this macOS application to capture their Skype calls.

After the recording session is completed you can choose if you want to export the recording as an MP3 audio file or as an HD video file. The lack of basic audio editing tools, effects or plugins makes ecamm Call Recorder for Skype a poor choice for all podcasters who want to polish the podcasts before sharing them with an online audience. This application for Mac computers can only be a complementary tool that enables podcasters to conduct remote interviews, but it cannot be your only choice if you want to create podcasts on a regular basis.

**Pros**

* Effortless recording session setup
* Lets its users export recordings as audio and video files
* Great for conducting interviews through Skype
* Requires no previous audio recording experience

**Cons**

* No audio editing tools
* Uploading audio files directly to podcast hosting services is not an option

You just have to send a link to your guest and this web-based podcast recorder will capture the interview in lossless 16-bit 44.1k quality. Zencastr separates tracks per guest which prevents quality drop-offs throughout the recording.

All interviews you record with Zencastr are edited automatically, so you don’t have to spend time adjusting the file’s audio levels.

In addition, you can create a solo recording from the app, and post them on Podbean, Libsyn, Blubrry and other podcast hosting platforms. Even so, Alitu’s automatic audio editing features are not powerful enough to compete with more advanced and more affordable podcast recording software products.

* Lets its users export recordings as audio and video files
* Great for conducting interviews through Skype
