If you are just starting your podcast or would like to take it to another level, then you need to have the right microphone. After all, the audio quality is the most important thing in your podcast and should not be taken lightly. Thankfully, with the help of a reliable **podcast microphone**, you can certainly improve the quality of your audio. Since there are so many options out there, I have handpicked the 9 best podcast microphones at entry, intermediate, and pro levels.

* [Part 1:What to Consider while Buying a Podcast Microphone?](#part1)
* [Part 2:Top 3 Podcast Microphones at Entry level](#part3)
* [Part 3:Top 3 Podcast Microphones at Intermediate Level](#part4)
* [Part 4:Top 3 Podcast Microphones at Professional Level](#part5)

## What to Consider while Buying a Podcast Microphone?

To select the best podcast microphone to meet your requirements, I would recommend keeping the following things in mind.

**Consider the microphone type**

Microphones can be classified based on their placement or working. For instance, you need to decide if you want to get a podcast microphone with a stand or a handheld one. Similarly, an omnidirectional microphone would function differently than a cardioid one.

**What and where are you recording?**

Getting a microphone to record speech would be different than the one to record music. Also, consider your setup and check whether the microphone would work with your other devices. Getting a podcast with polar sensitivity is better in almost every environment.

**Check the specifications**

Furthermore, make sure that you check specifications like impedance, connectivity, working frequency, ease of use, etc. before you purchasing a microphone.

**Budget and user reviews**

Lastly, make sure that you stick to a budget while filtering podcast microphones and check the review of its existing users to make up your mind.

Why would we want to remove audio from video?

There are many reasons why someone would prefer to remove the audio from a video file. Some of the videos captured will have a lot of noise in the background and that can be an annoying experience while watching the video. Some prefer to add different audio or a music file to their videos to make it more appealing and attractive to people. So whether it is to watch a silent video or a video with a different audio file, the original audio will have to be removed.

In no particular order, here we are going to discuss 4 different applications that can be used to remove audio from video without compromising the quality of your video.

_(All features of the samples are subjected to the time.)_

## Best Video Editing Software to Remove Audio from Video

Apart from removing sound from video, the applications below also offer features that can be used to further edit the audio file. Here are some of the best and preferred applications for audio removal and replacement.

* [**Part 1:**   **Wondershare Filmora**](#Part1)
* [****Part 2: VSDC Video Editor**](#Part2)
* [****Part 3: AudioRemover Tool**](#Part3)
* [**Part 4:** **Windows Movie Maker**](#Part4)

## [Part 1: Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora is a widely used video editing application around the world. No matter simple video editing, complicated video editing or even movie-making, Filmora has all the features which will give the best results. It also has special editing options aimed at social media uploads. Let us see how audio can be removed from a video file using Filmora:

* Download Filmora application below and install it on your computer

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* Open Filmora, then go to **File**\-**Import Media** and import the video clip from which audio needs to be removed to the Media Library

![import-media8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-media8.jpg)

* After importing drag the clip from the Media Library and drop it to the Timeline
* Right-click on the video file on the timeline and select the **Detach Audio** option

![detach-audio-filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-filmora.jpg)

* Now the audio will be displayed as a separate file on the audio track below

![detach-out-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-out-audio.jpg)

* Now tap on the audio file and select the **Delete** icon to totally remove the audio.

![no-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/no-audio.jpg)

Tips:

You can add fresh audio to your video clip the same way how added the video to the timeline (import, drag, and drop). Filmora also has features that allow further editing of an audio clip and adding effects.

## [Part 2: VSDC Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/)

VSDC is a widely used video editing application that can process videos of high resolution like VR 360-degree, 4K UHD, 3D videos. It also has features to record voice, video from the screen and save the file in any format of our choice. Let us see how audio can be removed from video by using VSDC:

* Open VSDC and import the file you wish to edit
* Right-click on the file using the mouse and select the **Properties** option from the menu. A small window will slide from the right side of the screen

![vsdc-properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-properties.jpg)

* At the very bottom end of the window, you will find a **Split to Audio and Video** tab, click it

![vsdc-split-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-split-audio.jpg)

* Now the audio file will be separated from the video file on the timeline

![vsdc-audio-out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-audio-out.jpg)

* Click on the audio file and hit **Delete**. The video can now be played without any sound

Tips:

VSDC also offers an option to mute the audio instead of deleting it, but the deletion of audio is the recommended process to get rid of audio.

## [Part 3: AudioRemover Tool](https://www.audioremover.com/)

AudioRemover Tool is a service that can be used to remove audio from a from any video without re-encoding it. It is an online service and can be used on Windows and Mac as well through a browser. People who do not want to go through downloading and installing a video editing application or who just want audio removed from video files without further editing can go with the AudioRemover tool. It supports almost all video formats like MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.

Let us see how audio can be removed using this tool:

* [**Click** **HERE**](https://www.audioremover.com/) and open AudioRemover online
* Tap the **Browse** option to select the source video and then click on the **Upload** Video button

![online audio remover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audioremover-online-audio-remover.jpg)

* Once the uploading is complete you will be able to download the video file (without audio) back by clicking the **Download File** option beside the Completed notification

![audio-remover-download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-remover-download.jpg)

Tips:

You need an active internet connection to use this tool and the videos above 500 MB cannot be uploaded to this tool.

## [Part 4: Windows Movie Maker](https://www.videowinsoft.com/videowin-movie-maker.html)

Windows Movie Maker is one of the simple editing applications which has a large number of users as it used to come as a part of the Windows Essentials software suite. Let us see how the audio removal can be done by Movie Maker.

* Open the Windows Movie Maker and import the video you wish to edit

![import-movie-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-movie-maker.jpg)

* Add the video to the timeline. Right click it and select **Remove Audio** (You can also select **Detach Audio**, and then the audio will be detached to the audio track)

![remove-and-detach](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-and-detach.jpg)

* The audio will be removed directly. It will show **No Audio** there**.**

![no-audio-movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/no-audio-movie.jpg)

#### To sum up
