**2\. How to Use Voice Chat on Steam?**

For initiating a voice chat with another user on Steam, you need to open up a regular chat, followed by clicking on the top right of the window. Select the option of 'Start Voice Chat' from the drop-down menu. It is up to the other person to accept or decline your offer of starting a voice chat on Steam. They will be notified through Steam notification, which will automatically decline after 20 seconds. If accepted, the incoming and outgoing voice can be controlled through the indicators on the chat window.
