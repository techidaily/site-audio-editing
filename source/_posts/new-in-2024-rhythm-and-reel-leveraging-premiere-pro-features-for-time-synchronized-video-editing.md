 A rapid succession of shots can make any music video or a feature film more entertaining to watch. The popularity of beat edits has gone through the roof in the era of social media videos, as so many YouTubers and video content creators produce videos that are perfectly synced to the music. This video editing technique can be used in a single scene or throughout an entire video, depending on the project and the effect you would like the video to make on the viewer. Read on if you would like to learn how to edit video clips to match the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?

 Before you start editing clips to the beat, you must first ensure that all of the materials you want to include in that video are imported into the project you created in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once the footage you intend to use in your video is in the Media Bin, you should head over to the **New** submenu in the **File menu**.

 Afterward, you can add an audio file to the timeline and ensure that the sequence settings are correct. The audio file is going to serve as the core around which you are going to build the entire video, which is why it is important to select a rhythmic song that has clearly distinguishable beats.

 Click on the **Wrench icon** and choose the **Show Audio Waveform** option from the drop-down menu, so that you can see the beats in the audio file. Make sure that the sequence you created is selected and not the audio file you added to the timeline and then position the playhead at the beginning of the song. Listening to the music to which you would like to edit your video a few times is recommended because it will enable you to better understand where the beats are located.

 When ready start adding markers to the sequence by using the **M keyboard shortcut**, so that every beat of the song contains a marker. This may take a few tries because hitting the beats can be difficult for video editors that don’t have any musical talents, but with practice, you should be able to position the markers precisely where they need to be. Also, you can make the adjustments to the video you’re creating after you sync your footage with the audio so even if the markers aren’t positioned perfectly you can make corrections later.

 Head over to the Media Bin and proceed to add **In and Out points**, by either clicking on their icons or using the **I and O buttons**, to all video clips you want to edit to the beat. By doing so you will let Adobe Premiere know which parts of the video clips you want to keep and where it should create cuts. After setting the In and Out points for all the video clips you would like to use in your project you just have to select them. The order in which your footage is selected is important as it will determine where they are going to be placed on the timeline.

 Choose the **Automate to Sequence** option from the **Clip menu** and once the Automate to Sequence window appears on the screen you should choose the **Selection Order** option from the **Ordering menu**. Afterward, you should select the **At Unnumbered Markers** setting from the **Placement menu** and change the **Method to the Overwrite Edit.**

 Make sure that the **Use In/Out Range** option is enabled and click on the **Ignore Audio** checkbox if your video clips also contain audio. Click OK to confirm the changes and Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically match your footage to the markers you added to the sequence.

## How to Edit Video Clips to the Beat of a Song with BeatEdit Extension for Adobe Premiere Pro?

 Placing markers at each beat in the song can be both difficult and time-consuming, which defeats the purpose of using Adobe Premiere Pro to automate this process. In case you are looking to save some time on adding markers to a sequence, you should try the Mamoworld’s [BeatEdit extension](https://mamoworld.com/tools/beatedit-premiere-pro) for Adobe Premiere Pro that analyses the music and adds markers automatically. Here’s how you can edit video clips to match the beat with BeatEdit.

**How to Edit Footage to the Beat in Premiere Pro with the BeatEdit Extension?**

 In order to download and install the BeatEdit in Adobe Premiere Pro, you must pay a one-time $99,99 fee. After you go through the installation process, you can launch BeatEdit from the **Extensions submenu** that is located in the Window menu.

 After the BeatEdit window pops up on the screen you should click on the **Load Music** button in order to start the beat detection process. After the audio file is analyzed blue lines are going to be displayed at each beat and you’ll be able to hear a click sound if you play the song. BeatEdit lets you adjust the volume of the audio file you analyzed and enables you to select the beats where you want to make the cuts in your footage.

 You can choose if you want to select beats evenly or randomly, specify their frequency or select the portion of the song from which you want to select the beats. The extension also lets you add extra markers that are not located at beat and adjust their amount or minimum distance. BeatEdit generates clip and sequence markers, so make sure that the sequence markers option is selected before clicking on the **Create Markers** button.

 Add the audio file you would like to use in your video to the Adobe Premiere Pro’s timeline and proceed to select the video clips in the Media Bin. Place the playhead at the beginning of the timeline and select the Automate to Sequence option from the Clip menu. You can then select the same settings you’d select if you added the markers to the sequence on your own.

**Conclusion**

 Editing videos to the beat of a song in Premiere Pro is becoming increasingly popular among video content creators. Hopefully, our tutorial has helped you learn this simple but effective video editing technique so that you can use it to make the videos your friends and followers on social media are going to enjoy watching. It is important to remember that how effective your beat edits are going to be, depends on the quality of the footage and the song selection.

# How to Record a Podcast Effortlessly: a Step-by-Step Guide

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

If you are looking for a guide on **how to record a podcast**, you are on the right platform. If you are still looking on whether to start a podcast or not, this is the right time to discover a less competitive yet high potential niche.

Start developing new skills before anyone else could and be pro within no time. A podcast creation is the journey of many stages, including selecting the topic, name, podcast cover art, equipment, intro/outro audio, recording/editing equipment, and the promotion strategy. Thus, you must select the type of content beforehand to start recording the podcast effortlessly.

On the other hand, don't get too complicated, especially when you are a beginner. This post is going to be an ultimate guide on how to record a podcast effortlessly. Without further introspection, let's get started with the initial preparations.

* [Part 1:How to Prepare for Recording a Podcast?](#part1)
* [Part 2:How to Record a Podcast on PC?](#part2)
* [Part 3:How to Record a Podcast on the iPhone?](#part3)
* [Part 4:How to Record a Podcast Remotely?](#part4)

## How to Prepare for Recording a Podcast?

To know how to record a podcast remotely, you must note the initial steps of preparation. And that is going to include content selection to choosing the right recording equipment.

**Plan the content**

The very first step is to plan the content of the podcast. Also, make sure that the topic or niche you will select must be up to your knowledge. It should be a topic for which you can discuss 100+ episodes. Invest the right amount of time in planning the content of the podcast.

**Choose co-host (optional)**

You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.

**Select the format, style, and length of the podcast**

After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.

**Consider Podcast Recording Equipment**

Don't think of investing in a fancy podcast recording studio, especially when you are starting. Professionals even say that the outdoors is useful when you are confident to speak in public. It will also offer a preview of the background hustle, which further looks attractive and engaging to the listener.

You can even start from a phone with a good microphone setup. It’s better to invest in a good-quality microphone and have your little format ready all by itself. Try looking for an audio mixer if you have gone a bit advanced in podcast recording.

**Recording Software**

The last decision before recording is the selection of recording software. As a beginner, we'd like to recommend Audacity, a free tool when working on audio podcasts. Or, you must check out Wondershare Filmora X to beautify your video podcasts.

## How to Record a Podcast on PC?

## How to Prepare for Recording a Podcast?

To know how to record a podcast remotely, you must note the initial steps of preparation. And that is going to include content selection to choosing the right recording equipment.

**Plan the content**

The very first step is to plan the content of the podcast. Also, make sure that the topic or niche you will select must be up to your knowledge. It should be a topic for which you can discuss 100+ episodes. Invest the right amount of time in planning the content of the podcast.

**Choose co-host (optional)**

You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.

**Select the format, style, and length of the podcast**

After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.

**Consider Podcast Recording Equipment**

Don't think of investing in a fancy podcast recording studio, especially when you are starting. Professionals even say that the outdoors is useful when you are confident to speak in public. It will also offer a preview of the background hustle, which further looks attractive and engaging to the listener.

You can even start from a phone with a good microphone setup. It’s better to invest in a good-quality microphone and have your little format ready all by itself. Try looking for an audio mixer if you have gone a bit advanced in podcast recording.

![edison podcast metrics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-1.jpg)

You must retain that Edison's research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.

Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it's all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.

### 1\. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.

Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.

![podcast directory youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-2.jpg)

Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create video-based podcasts seamlessly. You can simply convert the video podcasts into an audio format using Filmora itself and then reupload the same Podcast to even audio-based podcast directories.

Tools like Fimora also allow you to directly publish the created Podcast on YouTube (so you do not have to worry about video requirements mandatory for YouTube).

* **User Review of YouTube on G2**: "YouTube is one of those sites that you can't live without for a business. Everyone knows what YouTube is, and users (globally) use the platform daily."
* **Monthly User Base**: Over 2.5 billion active users.
* **Supported OS**: All major OS and web browsers.

### 2\. [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)

Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.

Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.

![podcast directory spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-3.jpg)

Spotify's personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily/ Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.

* **User Review of Spotify on G2**: "I can find any song, artist, album, and even podcasts at any time and no commercials."
* **Monthly User Base**: Over 360 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: All major OS and web browsers.

### 3\. [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasters.apple.com/)

Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.

It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.

"Wonderful app, the most reliable one I've found. Even with accounts, most others lose all your progress data which hasn't happened once with this, and I've switched phones 3 times.
