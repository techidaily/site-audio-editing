## "15 Free Music Pieces Recommended for Crafting Memorable Video Narratives"

The popularity of montages is increasing every day, as they allow you to use fewer words and express more. Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer's attention and communicate your message. We'll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.

## What Is Copyright?

If you are wondering: What is copyright? It's a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.

Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.

If you're caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you'll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone's intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.

Claiming you didn't know about the artist's copyrighted material doesn't excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.

If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist's consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.

The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.

For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.

You may find YouTube’s Audio Library under the "Create" feature. It includes a diverse range of musical styles. You are free to utilize any music in your video project.

The soundtrack is a combination of public domain, and Creative Commons licensed pieces. All you would need to do is credit the track's creator.

Just use library's search capabilities taking full advantage of it. You may, for example, search by emotion, such like "happy," "sad," or "boss battle." You may search for tracks based on their duration, which is a fantastic way to ensure that they suit the timeframe of your material.

Some other component on YouTube worth looking at would be their Music Policies section. Now you'll come across a number of famous tunes and also information about whether or not you're authorized to utilize them in YouTube videos and how to do so.

### SoundCloud

On the other hand, SoundCloud is a fantastic resource for music in marketing videos. You can narrow down your search to only include music that have been granted permission to be reused. Enter "scary laugh sound effect" or anything along those lines, such as "hyena laugh sound effect.

Enter "scary laugh sound effect" or anything along those lines, such as "hyena laugh sound effect. SoundCloud also benefits from including a social component, you see it when a specific music seems to have a number of "likes,". You'll know, people would appreciate your content if you utilize it.

The nicest part of using SoundCloud for background music is that the recordings seem more like actual music rather than a manufactured tune created for a promotional film.

### AudioBlocks

Music, sound effects, and clips are all available for royalty-free use at Audioblocks. Here on the platform, they offer over a hundred thousand tracks. Regrettably, it is no longer free.

However, the company provides an excellent deal: $149 for a year of unlimited downloads. That's a great deal when you realize you have access to tens of thousands of songs.

Users can narrow down their search to music that is just the perfect length for their content. That's a fantastic method to cut down on your editing efforts.

They include some intriguing subcategories for tracks, such as "hyena laugh sound effect," "canned laughter sound," "woman laughing sound effect," "which laugh sound effect," and so on, based on moods or feelings.

This is fantastic since you can quickly select music based on the content’s mood you want to convey.

## Part 2 Make Laughing Sound Effect by Yourself

Here is what you can do to create a sound effect by yourself. One way is to generate the sound effect by yourself.

For instance, if you want an evil laugh in mp3 format, you can ask your friends and relatives for a sample. It can even be a fun memory for both of you.

You can also record the laugh effect when you’re in a casual setting. Please note that the raw audio may not be usable without some significant editing to clean up ambient noise. This is where Wondershare’s Filmora comes into play.
