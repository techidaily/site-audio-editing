## Part 1\. Best Free Male to Female Voice Changers Online

### 1\. LingoJam

[LingoJam](https://lingojam.com/MaletoFemaleVoiceChanger) is a super-easy online voice changer to a girl. You can record the clip in real-time, directly from the sound recorder provided. It depends on your internet how much time the voice modification can take.

This website is mainly for pitch adjustment, and a higher pitch is the main feature needed for a girl's voice. The purpose of this voice changer is also to benefit those looking for voice therapy. Moreover, you can also upload recorded audio from your device and modify it.

![ change male to female voice with LingoJam](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/male-to-female-voice-changer-online-lingojam.jpg)

Though this one is a male-to-female voice changer online, it also has a version where you can change from female to male. When you have loaded the audio or recorded the voice, you need to tap on the pitch button. This button will open a range of options for you, where you will choose the level of pitch needed. It's an easy-to-use method and comes in handy anytime, anywhere. You can also see some other basic sound effects like chipmunk voice.

### 2\. Voice Changer

[VoiceChanger](https://voicechanger.io/)is another online and free tool to change your voice from male to female pitch. To alter voice to a more feminine one, you need to make the pitch higher.
