## Master Your Setlist: Top DJ Audio Repositories

Party background music is a constant form of entertainment. It has been there for as long as we can remember. We tend to connect to a particular kind of DJ. Of all the different genres, most of the artists and genres are inspired by Rock n' Roll. Party background music adds life to all the stories and moments. But where and how to get it?? Let's find out.

Regardless of age and favourite genre, we all enjoy a good DJ. There's this magic about good tunes, sound and connectivity; electronic background music makes us go gaga.

Are you also on the lookout for electronic background music? Do you want to build a rocking collection without spending much? With the abundance of resources on the internet, DJs have a vast opportunity to discover and download sounds for free. Let’s have a look-

### Streaming Platforms

Many sites have enormous libraries for DJs to create DJ background music. But today, these are replaced by the most fantastic streaming services like Spotify and Apple music.

You can hunt for DJ songs on these, but you'll have to download the files from another service if you do not have a compatible DJ programme. But these days, even these platforms are finding their way into DJ software.

The easier and best way is to explore the playlists that already exist on these apps. This way, you can discover new songs for DJ's based on the listening trends of the audience.

For example, apple music has playlists for nearly every genre, allowing you to keep updated with the latest tunes. Spotify's daily playlists are genre-based, and a fantastic blend of previously listened to songs and new tracks to compliment!

You may land up on new genres and impressive tracks in the process. This way, you can expand your search for good tracks. If you expose yourself to the digital radio on Apple Music or Spotify, you might find fantastic party sounds to add to your collection.

Independent and undiscovered artists sometimes offer their songs to use for free. Some established artists and labels also give out some freebies. If you have these resources up your sleeve, you won't have to worry about your budget. Take a look ahead at some of these below-
