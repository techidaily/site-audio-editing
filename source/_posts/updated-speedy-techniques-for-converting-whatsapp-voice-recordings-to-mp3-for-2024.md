_I have a High Definition MKV video here with 2 audio tracks: Russian and English. I want to turn this video to DVD but how would I remove the Russian and keep just the English audio?_

Or you may want to remove all the audio tracks and add some other audio files to it later. Now that can be very easy with the professional video editing tool - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)(originally Wondershare Video Editor). It’s a very effective MKV audio remover, very easy to use yet creates excellent result. Apart from removing audio from MKV, you can also use it to audio from AVI, FLV, MKV, MP4, M4V, PSP, 3GP, MOV and more. Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and follow the steps below to remove audio from MKV easily and quickly.
