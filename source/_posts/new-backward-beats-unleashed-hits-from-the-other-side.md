### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don't you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You'd be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.

## Is Volume Booster Safe?

You might think that pushing your speakers beyond what they are supposed to do might damage them? However, that is not true. Volume boosters are safe, especially for the **sound booster** apps mentioned above. These apps use advanced technology to boost the loudness of your smartphone by sacrificing clarity without damaging your phone. However, using these booster apps for short periods of time is recommended since they are built with limits for boosting volume.

These **sound boosters** are all top of standards apps that may change your life experience. If you haven't used any of the applications mentioned above, then it's time to improve your quality of life!
