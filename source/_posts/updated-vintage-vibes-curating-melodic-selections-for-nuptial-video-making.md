## Symphony of Screens: The Best Music Pairings for Every Type of Video Content

Montage is a film editing technique that combines a series of clips or shots into a single sequence. Background music is often applied to the final montage during compilation. We'll look at some of the best montage music for different video types and the benefits of adding them to your montage video.

## Why Music Is Important for Montage Video

Music plays an essential role in montage videos. Here are five reasons why you should add music to your montage video.

#### 1\. Music Captures Attention

One of the reasons people include music in montage videos is that it holds the audience's attention; it shapes emotion while motivating viewers. In addition to touching viewers, music makes the moving images in your montage video seem more beautiful and engaging. It also brings mood and dynamism to the video.

Musicologists have discovered that the choice of musical instruments, volume, harmony, and tempo play a vital role in montage video.

#### 2\. Music Takes Your Montage Video to the Next Level

By using music, you'll boost the cohesiveness and production value of your montage video. Your audience wants a professional montage video that is well-constructed and flows nicely. Music is the bridge that lets your montage video transition seamlessly between different scenes or ideas, particularly when you need to have a jump cut.

Additionally, montage music is a great way to fill in moments in your montage video that would have been silent. You can also use it to fill dead air in your video where there is a visual without sound.

#### 3\. Music Helps You to Communicate Your Message

Music is a vital component in conveying your message in your montage video. The music in your video should be in tune with the message you are trying to send.

#### 4\. Helps to Underscore the Unfolding Action

Montage music helps you to emphasize the action taking place in your video. As a result, this will make your audience focus on the action and get your message.

#### 5\. Helps You Create Rhythm for Your Montage Video

Music allows you to create a rhythm for scenes and clips in your montage video. A good rhythm can hold up your entire montage video.

Unfortunately, no application by default on your desktop or laptop, phone, or tablet would get this done. To replace audio in the video, you would need the help of state of the art software. Fortunately, you have Wondershare Filmora at your disposal.

With Wondershare Filmora, you can replace audio in the video, mute audio, detach the audio, and add audio. You can eliminate background noise, organic noise, sound effects, address the sync problem in a video file, and edit the audio in a video without any extensive training or expertise.

* It has a user-friendly interface which makes things simple even for amateurs.
* It supports all common video and audio formats, including WMV, MOV, FLV, MTS, MP4, etc.
* You can move audio, replace it or add new audio to the video without worrying about general loss, which is loss of quality.
* You can export the [edited video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with the new or edited audio to various devices, including the cloud and social media sites.
* Compatible with Windows (including Windows 8) & Mac OS X (10.6 and above).
