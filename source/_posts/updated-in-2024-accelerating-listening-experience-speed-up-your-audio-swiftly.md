Clean sound keeps people interested and helps them stay attentive to the story. Moreover, people tend to be hooked more to the information in the video. It helps viewers to stay engaged, follow what's happening, and enjoy watching the video.

### 5\. Availability and Diversity

Reducing background noise makes the speech clearer and easier to follow. Additionally, when subtitles or captions are available, then it makes the video more captivating. This makes the videos more accessible to more people with diverse backgrounds.

### 6\. Adjustable Editing Opportunities

Removing unwanted noise from the audio while editing a video gives us more flexibility. By doing so, you can work on your project later. Clean audio allows us to make accurate changes to the sound, like adjusting the volume or adding effects. Additionally, it makes your audio file better than before.

### 7\. Uniformity and Uninterrupted Flow

By eliminating noise, each video part will have a similar sound profile. Meanwhile, this will create a smooth and uninterrupted audio experience for the viewers. Consistent audio quality is important in providing a seamless and unified viewing experience.

### 8\. Audio Reconstruction

Eliminating such noises from audio is very helpful for fixing older or damaged recordings. It enhances the quality and makes it easier to understand audio. You can even reconstruct your old audio files and keep them safe. This will also help you to improve the quality of your old audio files.
