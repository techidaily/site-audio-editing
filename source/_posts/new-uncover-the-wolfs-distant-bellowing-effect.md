* Drag the clip to another place and release.

#### Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration

Step 1\. While the project is launched in the timeline, tap the audio clip (in blue or purple) or the background music clip you wish to adjust.

Step 2\. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won't move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip's end.

Step 3\. Tap outside the audio clip and let the trim handles disappear.

#### Split an Audio Clip

There are around two options to split audio clips in iMovie. You can remove unwanted parts or adjust each section's duration, volume, or speed while you split a clip.

Step 1\. When the project is open in the timeline, select a video clip and display the inspector at the screen's bottom.

Step 2\. Tap the **Actions** button, then tap **Detach**.

## Part 3: iMovie Audio Editing Tips & Tricks

iMovie is a great video editor for Mac computers. After understanding the best alternative of **iMovie sound editin** **g**, let's check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.

The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.

So, here we go!

### 1\. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear

To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.

You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can't be seen, go to the **View** drop-down menu and choose **the** **Show** **Waveforms** option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.

The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.

### 2\. Audio Adjustments

With the help of **Adjust** tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip's volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.

The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.

### 3\. Edit Audio with the Timeline

iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain **Fade In** and **Fade Out** tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade's length.

By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.

### 4\. Detach the Audio

By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.

For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the **Modify** drop-down menu, and hit the **Detach Audio** button. You'll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.

A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio's middle portion while leaving the video intact.

### Conclusion

Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding **iMovie audio editing**and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project's presence.

Step 2\. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won't move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip's end.

Step 3\. Tap outside the audio clip and let the trim handles disappear.

#### Split an Audio Clip

There are around two options to split audio clips in iMovie. You can remove unwanted parts or adjust each section's duration, volume, or speed while you split a clip.

Step 1\. With your launched project in the timeline, scroll the timeline to the playhead's position where you want to split the audio.

Step 2\. Click the audio clip to display the inspector at the screen's bottom.

Step 3\. Now, click the **Actions** button, and select the **Split** tab.

Or, you can tap the clip (it becomes outlined in yellow), then swipe above the playhead as if you were placing your finger to slide over it.

#### Detach the Audio Part from a Video

You can detach the video clip's audio to remove or edit it as a separate video clip.

Step 1\. When the project is open in the timeline, select a video clip and display the inspector at the screen's bottom.

Step 2\. Tap the **Actions** button, then tap **Detach**.

Step 3\. A new blue-colored audio clip will then appear below the video project. You can now move, edit, or delete the audio clip separately from its parent video clip.

#### Move Audio to the Foreground or Background

To ensure the sound in your video clips can listen above the background music, iMovie implies audio "ducking". Ducking lowers the background music clips' volume whenever there's a video clip whose sound is playing simultaneously.

You can select which audio clips are in the foreground or the background.

Step 1\. Select the timeline's audio clip to display the inspector at the screen's bottom.

Step 2\. Hit the **Actions** tab and proceed with selecting the **Foreground** or **Background**.

The clip color changes to indicate whether it's the background music (green) or foreground audio (blue or purple).

## Part 3: iMovie Audio Editing Tips & Tricks

iMovie is a great video editor for Mac computers. After understanding the best alternative of **iMovie sound editin** **g**, let's check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.

The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.

So, here we go!

### 1\. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear

To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.

You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can't be seen, go to the **View** drop-down menu and choose **the** **Show** **Waveforms** option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.

The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.

### 2\. Audio Adjustments

With the help of **Adjust** tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip's volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.

The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.

### 3\. Edit Audio with the Timeline

iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain **Fade In** and **Fade Out** tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade's length.

By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.

### 4\. Detach the Audio

By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.

For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the **Modify** drop-down menu, and hit the **Detach Audio** button. You'll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.

A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio's middle portion while leaving the video intact.

### Conclusion

Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding **iMovie audio editing**and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project's presence.
