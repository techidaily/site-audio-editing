So, if you are in search of some great **gamer chat apps,** then this article will help you find some of the best **gaming voice chat apps** from a number of choices available on the internet, alongside their advantages and disadvantages.

Here are the seven best **gaming voice chat apps** for your gaming communication obstacles.

### 1\. [Mumble](https://www.mumble.com/)

Available on: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux

This voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) application speaks for itself.

While holding more than 100 voice participants simultaneously, this voice chat application affirms connection throughout servers: providing a steadfast connection with your friends.

Mumble features a controlled environment for the users, conforming to a server version that can be bought for as low as $7.50/month, catering 15 slots in total. Mumble emphasizes middleware, allowing additional features across the platform for extending the experience in voice chat gaming.
