_How to add a .mka audio track to a .mkv video? Is there a simple step-by-step? I tried Mkvmerge but it doesn't seem to work with this._

 You may come across the same problem: want to add audio to MKV but find video editing tools like Mkvmerge doesn’t work. Well, then what’s the available way to do so? In this article, I’ll show you how to add audio to MKV file by using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). If you are looking for such a solution, just feel free to see the guide below. This program enables you to add specified audio track to MKV as well as apply more effects to your source file.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1 Add video and audio files

 Download and install Wondershare Filmora first. Once run it, click the “Import” button to load both the video and audio files. You can also directly drag and drop the media files to the program.

![remove audio from mkv](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Add audio to MKV

 Now what you have to do is to drop the video file to the Video track in the Timeline and audio to the Audio Track. Then you can make the audio file fit your video by trimming or double click the audio file to set fade in/out effects, speed up or slow down it, adjust volume so that it doesn't drown out the original audio of your video, etc. If you want to remove the original audio, just right click the video in Timeline and select “Audio Detach” and press “Delete” to remove audio from video.

 Besides adding an audio file, you can also use Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) to record and add your own voiceover. To do this, simply click the “Record” button on the toolbar and record the voiceover in the Record Audio window. Click the red button to get started and “OK” to save it and return to the main interface. The recorded voiceover will then appear in the audio track. Then adjust its position, volume, etc., just like any audio files.

#### 3 Export the new MKV file

 After adding audio, click “Play” to preview and listen to the new file. Then click “Create” to export your MKV file. Here are various choices for you: export the video to various video formats, convert the video to play on different mobile devices, upload the video to YouTube instantly or burn video to DVD disc. Select a desired output way and hit “Create” to start exporting the video file with the added audio.

Moving images are far less convincing if they are not accompanied by sound. That is the reason why all of the [glitch visual effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you add to your videos are going to be much more impactful if you add sound effects to them. Making glitch sound effects on your own can prove to be a demanding task, especially if you are not a skilled sound designer, but luckily you can solve this problem by downloading the effect that fits a particular sequence perfectly from the Internet. So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online destinations where you can find a huge number of different glitch effects you can use in all of your projects for free.

If you are running the latest version of [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or version after V10.5, you can now find the glitch sound in the Audio library directly by typing glitch in the search bar.

Moreover, some footage isn’t going to be available unless you choose to purchase a monthly or an annual subscription plan. Most glitch sound effects you can find on Audioblocks, the version of the Storyblocks platform dedicated solely to audio files, last only for a couple of seconds, which means that you can’t really use them for glitch scenes that are longer than that. Even though Audioblocks can be a valuable resource, the sound effects you can find here are only useful for short glitch sequences.

#### 3. [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/dotY21/packs/16933/)

![Freesound online glitch sound effect download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freesound-glitch-effect.jpg)

You can listen to each glitch sound effect and decide if it is a good fit for the project you’re working on. This platform can be quite useful if you are in need of a professionally recorded sound effect that matches the glitch visual effects you add to your videos.
