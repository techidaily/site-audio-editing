Using speech to text apps has become increasingly common. People use voice to text apps to compose business letters and memos, transcribe meetings to document discussions, write books; in short, just about anything they want to be laid out in the written form.

In most situations, a person can think and talk a lot faster than they can type or write. That is why using speech to text apps can speed up so many situations, either in a professional or personal setting. The problem is that using speech to text apps that are not of the highest quality can be a frustrating experience. The app may poorly transcribe what you are saying, or skip entire words altogether.

Rather than making your life easier, a poorly conceived speech to text app makes things even more complicated.

## Best 8 Speech to Text Apps for Android and iPhone

Below are the ten best speech to text apps that you can use to transcribe audio to text. These apps convert audio to text seamlessly and are available for Android or iOS devices.

### 1\. [SpeechTexter (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speechtexter.speechtexter)

SpeechTexter is a free app available on the Google Play Store that you can use to create text notes, sms, emails, or tweets using your spoken words.

There is also the possibility of creating your own commands for specific punctuation, along with adding unique words into the app’s dictionary.

The software allows you to work with more than 60 languages, while the recognition percentage is around 95 percent for the English language. The app does require an internet connection to work at its best, as the accuracy is lower in offline mode.

## "The Ultimate List of Free-to-Download Montage Music Sites"

In music, montage is a technique whereby newly branded compositions or sound objects, such as songs, are created from montage or collage. We will give you all the information you need to know before going for a montage music download. We will also highlight where you can get music tracks to add to your montage video.

## Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music

Before you download montage music, you must factor in the following crucial things:

#### 1\. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device

Unlike documents, montage music takes loads of space. If you plan to download many tracks, you might run out of disk space if your device has limited storage space. For this reason, before you start looking for downloadable montage music, check if you have ample space on your target drive.

If your disk space is almost depleted, you can delete some files that you rarely use or back them up in another drive. You can also uninstall apps or programs that you rarely use but are readily available online. If you are using your mobile device to download montage music, you can expand the memory.

#### 2\. The Safety of Your Device

When looking for free downloadable montage music, you have to factor in the safety of your device. Attacks by cybercriminals are now targeting individuals. Be extra vigilant with the platforms you choose. The site you pick should have a good reputation in dealing with threats.

Before you download montage music, you need to consider the site you are getting them from: Not all sites are equal in quality and legality; some may be more reliable.

Do your research before downloading montage music from any site. Ensure the website is legit to avoid downloading files with malware or viruses.

#### 3\. Internet Connectivity

You'll need a strong internet connection to montage music download. Most people use mobile phone contracts with specific data caps that do not allow venturing outside email or the usual social media connection.

If you download montage music using a phone contract, there's a risk that you might exhaust the allocated data and incur additional charges. You should, therefore, understand when and where to download montage music.

If you've got free Wi-Fi at work, you might want to schedule all the montage music downloads and run them while doing your job. You can also download montage music using free Wi-Fi hubs around establishments like government facilities and hospitals. But, be extra careful with open Wi-Fi, as cybercriminals use this channel to hit targets.

#### 4\. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music

When downloading montage music, it’s crucial to be aware of its copyright status. Some montage music tracks have copyright law protection, meaning downloading them will be violating the law.

Before you download any montage music online, read the download site's terms and conditions. In turn, this will help you to understand what is allowed and what is not.

#### 5\. The Quality of the Montage Music File

Some montage music files you'll find online are of low quality. And this can affect your audience's listening experience. Before you get any downloadable montage music, check its quality.

## Top 10 Websites to Download Montage Music
