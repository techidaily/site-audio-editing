This is a next-level audio video mixer that we find to be an excellent option for mixing, recording, editing, and restoring files.

Adobe Audition provides two mixing modes: the waveform view and the multitrack view. While the Waveform view is ideal for stereo editing, the multitrack view allows users to edit tracks on a timeline. Luckily Audition enables you to switch between both views whenever you want, so you don’t have to choose one.

One of the impressive features that make Adobe Audition one of the best audio video mixers in 2022 is the ability to remove silence from inactive parts in the audio file. While doing this, you don’t have to lose sync in the file. As a result, it is ideal for podcasts and interview audios.

Another nice feature we found impressive with Audition is the DeReverb tool that allows you to eliminate or remove reverberations from the audio file. IT efficiently handles short delays and spacious reverbs in your video and audio files. The sound remover tool is another impressive tool that allows you to remove car alarms, errant bumps, paper shuffling, and other unnecessary sounds from your audio and video file. You also gain access to the music remix tool that allows you to cut new versions of songs without necessarily sending them to the remixer.

You can efficiently adjust the song’s target duration to help you get the perfect fit. You can also customize the splices or favor rhythm elements to ensure the beats remain locked when necessary. All the functions available on Adobe Audition are useful for your audio and video mixes.
