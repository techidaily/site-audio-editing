Instead, you can use one of the various online video editors for putting music over videos. Such video editors are completely free and do not use your computer’s processor which makes them great for entry level computers which cannot run heavy video editing programs.

![kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/video-app-4.jpg)

While all the various video editor apps given above are great for easily adding music to videos, all of them require you to have a computer for using them.
