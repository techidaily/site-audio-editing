You can upload the audio from your computer or use the microphone to record your own voice over. Remember, the audio file is **limited to 100 MB** at uploading. This online voice changer provides about 50 **voice templates** that you can use including Dalek Robot, Alien Robot, Frog Robot, Ghost, and chipmunk.

You can download the changed voice in **.wav format** without any difficulty. Besides, voicechanger.io also allows you to create customizable voice by adding audio effects such as pitch shift, phaser, speed, and alien robot. It also provides a Female and Male voice to try if you don’t want to upload your own voice file.

Above are the simple free ways that you can change voice in videos. You can complete the voice changing via some desktop video editing software like Filmora or with the online video changer tool. Some good voice changer apps may not list above but please share your favorite in the comment and let me know your choice.
