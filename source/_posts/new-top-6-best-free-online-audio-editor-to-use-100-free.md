The frequency and tone of the music matter with the video. If the video has more dialogues and talking, the users should pick the instrumental background music with the same notes as human voices. The emotional tones of the guitar, violin, cello, viola, and keyboard would help in this situation as they would complement the voice in the video.

### 5\. Video Length

### 6\. Video Message

As far as the video's message is concerned, it is recommended to keep the content in mind while making a choice. The MP3 instrumental music includes five classes such as percussion, woodwind, brass, keyboard, and string. Make sure that your video story is not neglected with your music choice.
