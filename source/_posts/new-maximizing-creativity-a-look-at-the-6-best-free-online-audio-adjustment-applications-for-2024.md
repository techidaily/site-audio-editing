This video editor allows you to adjust the audio speed. It can't just increase or decrease the speed of the audio. You can also decide if the music should 'fade in' or 'fade out.' You can also adjust the volume of the audio you're playing.

##### Step 6 Export File

You can now export the file as an mp4\. If you choose to export the file as a gif, you will lose the audio, so please be careful when exporting the file. Also, a gif cannot be longer than 30 seconds, or it becomes a video.
