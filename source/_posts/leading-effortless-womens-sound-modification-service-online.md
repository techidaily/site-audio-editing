The Audio Joiner tool lets you import audio files from online sources or from a computer so you can choose the method that is the most convenient for you. Once you’ve uploaded all the files you’d like to merge you can simply drag them in order to rearrange them, and then you can proceed to select the output format, apply the crossfade effect or rename the new audio file. Click on the Merge button to complete the process and then save the freshly created file to your computer. The only downside is that MP3Cutter doesn’t allow you to store the audio files you merged on Dropbox and other cloud storage services.

#### 8. [Online MP3 Cutter](https://www.bearaudiotool.com/)

 Turning your favorite songs into ringtones or merging several audio files into a single MP3 file are just a few options presented by the Online MP3 Cutter tool. You can upload audio files directly from your computer, import them from YouTube or use their URL to add them to the Online MP3 Cutter. The platform also lets you record new audio files or copy, cut and crop the existing audio files. The fade in and fade out effects are also available so that you can gradually introduce a new song, while the Mute option helps you turn parts of the audio file you don’t want to include in the new audio file silent. Despite the fact that Online MP3 Cutter enables you to merge multiple audio files quickly you’re going to need at least a basic level of audio editing skills in order to use this tool efficiently.

#### 9. [MP3Merge](https://freeonlineeditor.com/mp3merge.php)

 All you have to do to start merging your MP3 files is drag and drop them to a specified area of the screen. Each file you add to this tool will be displayed in the order in which you uploaded them, which is why it is important to import MP3 files in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output file. This online audio editing tool lets you specify the start and end times of each audio file you import so that you can merge only a selected portion of each audio file. Click on the Merge Now button when ready and specify the location on your hard drive where you want the new audio file to be saved

#### 10. [AudioTrimmer](https://audiotrimmer.com/)

 This online audio editing tool enables you to remove unwanted parts of your MP3 files in just a few seconds. Simply upload the file you’d like to trim and specify the start and end points. Optionally, you can apply the fade in and fade out effects before cropping the file and saving it to your computer. AudioTrimmer can be a valuable asset if you need to clean up your audio files before merging them together or if you simply want to create a new ringtone for your phone. The platform supports nearly all audio file formats, but its output format selection is limited to just MP3 and M4r file formats.

**Conclusion**

 Each of the online MP3 joiners we covered in this article is easy to use, so you don’t really have to be a sound editing professional in order to merge your MP3 files with them. However, the options they offer are slightly different so you should choose the MP3 merger that best fits your needs. Which online audio editing tool are you using to merge multiple MP3 files? Leave a comment and let us know.
