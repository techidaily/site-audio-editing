## Sound Effects for Podcasts: 11 Places To Find Them

When people hear podcasting, they assume that it involves long speeches, but it is not so. For many creators, the concern for **how to write podcast scripts** that attract listeners involves adding sound effects. Doing so improves the quality of the audio content and appeals to listeners.

The dynamic **sound effects for podcasts** can help highlight specific moments/reactions/information, add to the atmospheric feel of the show, or prepare a unique intro tune. Different tools are useful for inserting the best sound effects into such shows. Let's learn which ones they are and how they work.

## Benefits of Adding Sound Effects in Podcasts

Before discussing what tools can help editors add sound effects to podcast episodes, we should refresh on why it is vital. Here are some of the best benefits you can expect from inserting sound effects for podcasts:

* **Thematic or mood setting**

With a sound effect, you can portray a specific theme for your podcast that gives the users an instant feel of your brand/channel. For example, if a podcaster is creating a podcast show for the True Crime genre, spooky and moody background sound effects set the mood. Comedy or commentary podcasts can use mood-based sound effects like a laugh track with their content.

* **Point emphasis**

Many podcasters utilize sound effects at pivotal moments of their content, e.g., to emphasize a cliffhanger in story-form podcast episodes. Like the boding and italicizing methods are useful in text documents to emphasize parts, you can adjust sound effects to do the same for your audio-based content. These can accentuate the dialogue and evoke specific emotional responses from the audience.

* **Transition points**

Most podcasters utilize the **best sound effects for podcast** shows to act as a transition between conversational segments. For example, some use these effects as outros or intros.
