Filmora analyzes audio and video files and replaces the existing audio with the newly selected audio file. Once the synchronization process is over, the new merged file will be available in the Media Panel for future processing.

The synchronized file will have the same terminology as the original video file with a difference. It will get an extension Merged to its name.

The original file will not get affected in Filmora. This software tool only references the files to generate a new file. The new file created when you add audio to the video can now be added to the timeline and exported.
