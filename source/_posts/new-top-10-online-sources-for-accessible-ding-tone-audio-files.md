## Utilizing the Audio Capture Tool in Samsung S10/S9 Smartphones

Smartphones make our life easy and productive. Being portable and bringing advanced features, Android and iPhone devices have improved the user experience multifold. The Samsung Android device and its voice recording feature would be the crux of the article.

Additionally, the write-up introduces the key features of three voice recorders on Samsung. Wondershare Filmora would be recommended as the most workable audio editing software. So, without delaying this any further, let us initiate this!

#### In this article

01 [How to Record Voice/Audio on Samsung S10/S9?](#part1)

02 [3 Popular Voice Recorder for Samsung](#part2)

03 [Recommend Audio Editing Software -Wondershare Filmora](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Record Voice/Audio on Samsung S10/S9?

The Samsung S10/S9 comes up with an in-built voice recorder app that handles all the recording-related concerns. A Samsung user, most probably, S10/S9 user, understands the workability of the voice recorder and its three modes. However, if you plan to buy S10/S9 to address your voice recording concerns, how about we give you a guided tour?

The article presents guidelines for how to record audio on Samsung S9 and how to record audio on Samsung S10\. Let us begin!

### Step 1: Launching the Voice Recording App

For starters, launch the Voice Recording app from your Samsung S10/S9\. The tool offers you three modes to select based on your audio preferences.

### Step 2: Standard Mode

The first mode is "Standard." It is considered a simple and fast voice recording. To use the "Standard" mode, perform the following steps.

* Click on "Standard" and then hit the "Record" button located at the bottom of the screen.
* After you have done your recording, click on "Stop" and save it.

![standard mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/voice-recording-on-samsung-s10-1.jpg)

### Step 3: Interview Mode

The next mode is the "Interview" mode. This mode makes use of two microphones, which are connected at each end of the phone. The mode works like a charm when you are expected to record a conversational interview. To use the "Interview" mode, follow the steps given below:

* Choose "Interview" and then click on the "Record" button.
* Click on "Stop" after you are done with the audio recording. After that, click on "Save" to save the final output.

![interview mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/voice-recording-on-samsung-s10-2.jpg)

### Step 4: Speech-to-Text Mode

"Speech to Text" is the last mode presented by the default voice recorder in Samsung S10/S9\. It converts your words into text efficiently. The user is only expected to choose the final output language that you want to transcribe into. Follow the step-by-step guide below to use this mode.

* Pick "Speed to Text" mode. Hit the "Record" button once you have gathered your thoughts.
* Now, start speaking, and the audio will be converted into text. Click on "Stop" and then save the recording.
