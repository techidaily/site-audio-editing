Have you ever used this editor before? As we mentioned in the introduction, we would introduce the steps to use Beautiful Audio Editor, so here we are. Are you ready to learn about its step-by-step guidelines? Let's get started!

Step 1: To start the editing, open the online editor. A timeline screen will appear in front of you; head to the ‘File’ tab and click on it from the top menu bar. From the sub-menu, select the ‘Import local sound file’ option to import the file from your device.

Step 2: For splitting the audio, drag the play head to the point from where you want to split. Next to the toolbar, click on the ‘Split’ icon. This will split the audio into 2 parts, and you can split as much as you want to. By using the ‘Remove’ icon from the toolbar, you can also remove the extra audio part.

Step 3: For adding Fade to your audio, move to the line under the timeline. Now, select a start and an endpoint on the line and drag it downwards for Fade Out. In comparison, push it upwards for Fade In.
