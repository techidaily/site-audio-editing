"FaceFlow" lets you communicate with your friends by video. However, you can also speak with strangers. It is now possible for users to create a searchable profile and upload YouTube videos and pictures. This site is more than just another webcam chat service - it is more comparable to Skype's excellent communication service. One-on-one video chat is available, as well as text messaging. FaceFlow has also introduced a multiplayer game called Flappy that looks challenging.

 **Features:**

      * Create video conferences or create your own
      * Participate in online chat rooms
      * Instant message sending and receiving
      * You can upload private photos and share them with others
      * Meet random strangers for private conversations

There is no better way to practice face-to-face communication before you get back into the dating pool.
