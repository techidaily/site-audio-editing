Making music is something we are not all gifted with the ability to do. For those that are, the new digital age has introduced multiple new ways to record, edit, and eventually produce new tunes in the best possible level of quality. To process these new tunes, we need DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), of which only some can be used from a phone.

We took a look at the best DAW for the iPad and the best DAW for iPhone to help you make a decision on which is right for you.

* [**Part 1: Best iOS DAW for iPad**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Best iOS DAW for iPhone**](#part2)

## Part 1：Best iOS DAW for iPad

Without further ado, let’s start with the best iOS DAWs for iPads.

### 1\. [GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785#?platform=ipad)

**Price:** Free with optional pay-to-add features

[GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785#?platform=ipad) is a high-quality DAW that allows you to use the Audio Unit (AU) standard. You can edit, enhance, distort, add an echo, and even a reverb, all through this one platform. GarageBand is the best iOS DAW for iPad if you happen to be a beginner. It does lack some of the finesse of the more significant, more professional systems.

**Features:**

* Apple sound and loop library is packed with choice and easily accessible.
* Can use it to download plugins from other people.
* Easy to follow for beginners, lets you edit 24-bit recordings.

* Quickly make great music on a DAW you can get to grips within less than a half-hour.
* Uses simple instruments grouped together for specific functions (gadgets) with hundreds of controls each for maximum individuality.

**How to add Sound and Edit your Voiceovers for Podcasts with Filmora?**

Step1 Download and launch the Wondershare Filmora 11 software on your PC or Mac device.

Step4 When the editor program opens, tap on the drop-down menu below the top-most toolbar for Record. From the options, select the "Record a Voiceover" choice.

Step5 The recording pop-up window will open. Click on the big red record button after the input microphone/speaker settings, and start speaking. When you are done, click the square red stop button. Press OK to save.

Alternatively, you can click on the Microphone icon. Please wait 3 seconds and then start speaking into the microphone and click it again after you are done speaking. The newly recorded file will automatically come in the audio track timeline.

Step6 Click the audio track in the timeline. Among the settings, make changes as you prefer in Pitch, Volume, and Speed. Cut the sections of your voiceover recording you want to remove and add fade-in/fade-out effects. After making all changes, click OK.

![after making changes click ok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/change-audio-track-settings.jpg)

Step7 If you have the recording of the narration already available in other locations, like your phone or device, import it into the software.

Step8 Add transitions, effects, and titles from the respective tabs on the top toolbar.

![add titles from the title tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/add-titles.jpg)

Step9 To add sound effects, go to Media and acquire the new audio clip or effect to add. Go to Effects > choose Audio Effects. Download the sound effect you want to insert and drag it onto the clip in the timeline.
