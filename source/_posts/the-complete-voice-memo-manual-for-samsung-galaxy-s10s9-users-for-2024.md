## Part 1: How to Fade Music and Audio in iMovie on Mac

There are two ways available to fade music and audio with iMovie. One is using the fade handles, and the other is using the audio inspector. Before using iMovie audio fade-out effects, please import your video and audio files to iMovie and start a new project.

### Method 1: Use Fade Handles to Add Fade in/Fade out Effect in iMovie

Firstly, let's take a look at the video below to check how to fade audio in/out the audio in iMovie with fade handles.

#### Step 1. Enable Audio Waveform

When the project opens, check "Show Waveforms" at the bottom of the Project window.

![Show Audio Waveforms -iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-waveforms-imovie.jpg)

**Note:** The Blue waveforms indicate the sound recorded within your video clips. Green and purple waveforms indicate sounds and music you’ve added to your project.

#### Step 2. Move Pointer to Apply Fade Effects

Move the pointer over a waveform, and drag the small gray fade handle at the left of the clip to adjust the fade audio in effect. Then drag the small fade handle at the right of the clip to adjust the fade-out effect.

![iMovie fade in audio pointer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-audio-fade-in-pointer.jpg)

#### Step 3. Playback to Check

Move the playhead to the beginning part of the clips with fade effects to check the fade-in and fade-out effects. If everything works OK, uncheck "Show Waveforms" to hide the waveforms.

![imovie audio fade out pointer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-audio-fade-out-pointer.jpg)

**Related:** [How to Remove Background Noise from Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Method 2: Use the Audio Inspector to Apply Fade in/Fade Out Effect in iMovie

To fade audios in and out in iMovie with the audio inspector, you can follow these steps:

#### Step 1. Open Your iMovie Project and Select a Clip

Double-click the video clip, choose "Clip Adjustments" to open the Inspector, and then click the "Audio" tab.

![resize video](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/imovie-audio-fade-effects.jpg "resize video")

If there are two audio tracks, and you want to set the fade in and fade out in iMovie for the background music, you can double-click the background music clip to open the audio inspector. This inspector is a little different. If you don't know how to add background music to iMovie, you can refer to this post: [add background music in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### Step 2. Set the Fade In and Fade Out Effect

In the window, you can manually set the fade-in and fade-out length by dragging the slider bar to the right or left.

If you do not choose "Manual", that means you'd like iMovie to automatically set it for you. Usually, when you drag video clips to the Project, iMovie will set the fade-in and fade-out effect randomly by increasing the audio volume at the beginning of the clip and decrease the volume at the end of the clip.

If you manually adjust the effect, you can have a better effect.

#### Step 3. Save the Audio Fade In and Out Effect

![imovie fade audio done](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-fade-audio-done.jpg)

After the settings, you can preview the effect in the viewing window to make sure all goes well, and you are much satisfied. Then click "Done" to save the audio fade-in and fade-out effects in iMovie.

Now, that's done! I hope the above information does help you to set the fade effects to smooth your video and audio transitions.

## Part 1: How to Fade Music and Audio in iMovie on Mac

There are two ways available to fade music and audio with iMovie. One is using the fade handles, and the other is using the audio inspector. Before using iMovie audio fade-out effects, please import your video and audio files to iMovie and start a new project.

### Method 1: Use Fade Handles to Add Fade in/Fade out Effect in iMovie

Firstly, let's take a look at the video below to check how to fade audio in/out the audio in iMovie with fade handles.

#### Step 1. Enable Audio Waveform

When the project opens, check "Show Waveforms" at the bottom of the Project window.

![Show Audio Waveforms -iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-waveforms-imovie.jpg)

**Note:** The Blue waveforms indicate the sound recorded within your video clips. Green and purple waveforms indicate sounds and music you’ve added to your project.

#### Step 2. Move Pointer to Apply Fade Effects

Move the pointer over a waveform, and drag the small gray fade handle at the left of the clip to adjust the fade audio in effect. Then drag the small fade handle at the right of the clip to adjust the fade-out effect.

![iMovie fade in audio pointer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-audio-fade-in-pointer.jpg)

#### Step 3. Playback to Check

Move the playhead to the beginning part of the clips with fade effects to check the fade-in and fade-out effects. If everything works OK, uncheck "Show Waveforms" to hide the waveforms.

### Method 2: Use the Audio Inspector to Apply Fade in/Fade Out Effect in iMovie

To fade audios in and out in iMovie with the audio inspector, you can follow these steps:

#### Step 1. Open Your iMovie Project and Select a Clip

Double-click the video clip, choose "Clip Adjustments" to open the Inspector, and then click the "Audio" tab.

![resize video](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/imovie-audio-fade-effects.jpg "resize video")

If there are two audio tracks, and you want to set the fade in and fade out in iMovie for the background music, you can double-click the background music clip to open the audio inspector. This inspector is a little different. If you don't know how to add background music to iMovie, you can refer to this post: [add background music in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### Step 2. Set the Fade In and Fade Out Effect

In the window, you can manually set the fade-in and fade-out length by dragging the slider bar to the right or left.

If you do not choose "Manual", that means you'd like iMovie to automatically set it for you. Usually, when you drag video clips to the Project, iMovie will set the fade-in and fade-out effect randomly by increasing the audio volume at the beginning of the clip and decrease the volume at the end of the clip.

If you manually adjust the effect, you can have a better effect.

#### Step 3. Save the Audio Fade In and Out Effect

![imovie fade audio done](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-fade-audio-done.jpg)

After the settings, you can preview the effect in the viewing window to make sure all goes well, and you are much satisfied. Then click "Done" to save the audio fade-in and fade-out effects in iMovie.

Now, that's done! I hope the above information does help you to set the fade effects to smooth your video and audio transitions.
