You have watched trailers for movies, TV shows, and YouTube videos throughout the year. Your ears have heard radio advertisements and podcasts. It has dawned on you that deep voices sound much better than shallow voices. However, how to make your voice deeper?

Nature would list voice deepening at the top of her list of requests if she had one. People who use their voices as a source of income, voice actors, and even the everyday person think about reducing the pitch of the sound they make.

Speaking with a deeper voice can help you sound more authoritative or become a better speaker. We have conducted extensive research on this topic, and controlling your breathing is one way to make your voice deeper, but it requires a lot of practice. Likewise, you can project your voice and try various techniques to use when you speak deeply, such as swallowing before you start to speak.

If you want to learn how you can make your voice deeper, then you just landed on the right page. In this article, we will suggest to you some natural tips to make your voice deeper, but it is a very time-consuming process because it needs a lot of practice. There is another method to make your voice sound deeper if you are recording it for videos or any other purpose. There are many software and apps available in the market today that can help you alter your voice and make it sound deeper. This article will show you how you can make your voice deeper using Filmora X.

So, Let's start our article with a basic question.

## **Can You Make Your Voice Deeper?**

Yes, It is possible to make your voice deeper.

It is possible to train your voice for a deep, more attractive sound even though you cannot lower it. According to numerous sources online, you can achieve a lower voice pitch by doing specific exercises. However, experts and physicians have not tested these deep voice exercises, which can lead to long-term harm to your throat.

![microphone-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microphone-poster.jpg)

## **How To Make Your Voice Deeper Naturally?**

**1\. Listen to Yourself**

First of all, you have to think about what you have to work with. Record yourself talking with the app on your phone that records audio. If you do not listen carefully to your voice, you will not know what needs to be fixed.

Take a moment to listen to your voice. Because you're now hearing your voice from an external perspective, it might sound completely different from how you thought it would. You can't always avoid mistakes, but you can learn from them.

Take note of how you sound and accept that this is exactly how you sound. During this exercise, listen carefully as words come out of your mouth, study your pitch, and record your voice so you can review the recording later after you've completed your exercise.

**2\. Relax Your Muscles**

As a consequence of stress, bad posture, and injuries, our muscles are drowning in tension. Our entire lives involve the use of our bodies, which directly affects our muscles and adds a great deal of tension. There are four key areas of our body. If you want to make your voice deeper, then you have to release tension from these four key areas. They include the tongue, jaw, throat, and neck. All these organs play a key role in controlling your voice. So, if you are able to relieve stress from these organs and you are able to relax them, then you can easily make your voice deeper with a little practice.

**3\. Use Your Diaphram**

If you're wondering how to make your voice deeper, you shouldn't use your chest for breathing when we have a whole respiratory system to control. As a rule of thumb, the deeper your voice sounds, the deeper the air you inhale goes. You can direct the air to go just where you want it by adjusting the diaphragm.

As you breathe in, bring your nose to your mouth and push your chest backward while taking deep breaths from your nose. When you exhale, tell yourself your full name as you do so. When you speak, you may feel a vibration. It is now easier for you to produce a deeper voice effect since you have learned how to use your diaphragm.

In the world of professional singing, diaphragmatic breathing is one of the most popular techniques. With it, they can control their voice and position it precisely when they want, to produce deep, low-pitched cries (or even high-pitched cries). When you first start, you won't be able to do it naturally, but you'll be able to do it subconsciously with practice.

**4\. Practice Your Chest Voice**

The magic happens in your chest voice. You can make it sound stronger, deeper, and less nasal with a little control. These exercises will focus on deepening your voice since you're looking for ways to make your voice deeper.

Engage your throat first and then speak normally. You will sound lighter and less confident if you usually speak through your nose, which is not good for a deep voice.

Make a hissing sound while exhaling a deep diaphragmatic breath. Having your voice-controlled right within your lungs will allow you to open up your chest. It would help if you started talking now. You will feel your voice flowing up and out of your mouth via your breath. This is the voice of your chest.

**5\. Hum Like You Mean It**

Humming warms up your voice, making it easier to control. In addition, it unleashes feelings of relaxation throughout your entire body, so your muscles can be relaxed. With Hum, you'll be able to lower your voice pitch, talk deeper, and even make your voice sound deeper in a video. Hold your breath with a deep humming for as long as possible. During this process, your vocal cords will be stretched, and stretched vocal cords always give a voice a deeper tone.

As you breathe in again, point your chin downwards toward your chest. Put your chin up and start humming. Speak now. You will feel intense and deep in your voice.

These are some of the natural ways to make your voice deeper. But the thing is, all of them need a lot of practice, and according to experts, one can also damage his vocal cords when practicing all these techniques. But as we told you earlier, there is an easier way of making your voice deeper which is discussed below.
