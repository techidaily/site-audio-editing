## **How To Change Your Voice Using Filmora Version 10.5**

In this article, we will discuss three different methods to change your voice in Filmora.

      1. **[Using Tune-up or Tune Down Option](#a)**
      2. **[Using Equilizer Option](#b)**
      3. **[Using Filmora Audio Effects](#c)**

Let's discuss every method one by one in detail and see how you can easily change your voice in Filmora. First of all, make sure that Filmora version 10.5 is installed in your system. If it isn't already installed, you can visit the official website of Wondershare Filmora and download it from there. If you have an older version of Filmora Installed on your system, then you can update it. The best thing about Filmora is that you can download it for free and use all its features without paying anything. The only drawback here is that the final output of your video will have a watermark on it, which you can easily remove by purchasing Filmora.

### **1\. Using Tune-up or Tune Down Option**

**Step1:** Open Filmora and Import your desired video to filmora by going into a file, then clicking on import, and selecting import media files from there.

**Step 2:** Now drag and drop the video file to your timeline and double click on it to open the clip settings. You will see different options here; make sure to select the audio to open the audio settings.

![tune-up-or-tune-down-step3.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tune-up-or-tune-down-step3.png)

**Step4:** Once you have done adjusting the pitch of your voice, click ok to apply changes to your audio.

**Step5:** Now play the audio, and you will notice a considerable change in your voice. Even if you show the video to your friends and family, they won't even recognize your voice.

### **2\. Using Equilizer Option**

**Step1**: First of all, repeat all steps that we did in option one and open the audio settings of your video clip.

![equilizer-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/equilizer-step1.png)

**Step2:** Not go to the equalizer option and click on the arrow in front of the equalizer option.

![equilizer-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/equilizer-step3.png)

**Step4:** You can select any preset of your choice from this menu. Like if you want to make your voice sound very crisp, then you can choose Sparkle preset.

**Step5:** Once you have selected your desired preset, click the ok button to apply it to your video.

**Step6:** Now listen to your video's audio, and you will notice a considerable difference in the voice of your video.

![equilizer-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/equilizer-step4.png)

Also, don't forget to tick that auto normalization box at the bottom of the audio settings for the above-mentioned methods. It will automatically normalize your video's audio and make it sound more professional.

### **3\. Using Filmora Audio Effects**

The third method you can use to change your voice in a video is through the audio effects of Filmora.

**Step1:** Click on the Effects tab from the top menu, and you will see an audio effects option in the left sidebar.

![audio-effects-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-effects-step1.png)

**Step2:** You can see there are a lot of audio effects available to use in your videos.

**Step3:** If you want to apply any effect on your audio, drag the effect and drop it above your video in the timeline. A yellow symbol will appear on the video file, indicating that the effect has been applied to your audio.

![audio-effects-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-effects-step3.png)

**Step4:** Now play the video, and you will see that the audio effect has been applied to your voice, and it sounds a lot different.

It’s all fun when recording and posing for great videos, not until you realize that the quality of the sound is far below your expectations, the joy derived fades off and you seek ways in which to perfect the quality of sound. Whenever you rely on the microphone of your camera, the sound recorded may be similar to that of someone mumbling in a cave. When the sound is of importance to you just like the images are, it is worth investing in an experienced audio producer to help the muffled sounds be much cleaner and clear. Generally, the biggest reason as to why one would want to improve the audio quality is to give presentable videos with clear audios and benefit from them.
