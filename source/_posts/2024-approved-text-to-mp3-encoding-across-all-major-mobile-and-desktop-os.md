##### Step2 Add and make the audio file

Adding the audio file to Filmora Media Panel makes it a media asset and can now be used multiple times in future projects. The original file remains as Filmora doesn’t change the original audio file.

##### Step3 Copying or deleting an audio file

In Filmora, using the feature of copying or deleting an audio file, you can work on the audio and video from any computer or remote PC.

## Part 3 Adding Audio to Video files

Using Filmora, it is easy to sync or add audio to the video, which is separately recorded and stored on your device.

Using Filmora, it is easy to sync or add audio to the video, which is separately recorded and stored on your device.

##### Step1 Click on Import in the Media Panel

Select the audio and video files to import them into Filmora.

##### Step2 Click on the video file to add audio

Press the Ctrl key (Windows) or Cmd key (Mac OS) and click on the audio file.

##### Step3 Add audio to video

Right-click on the files selected and choose the Merge audio & video option to add audio to the video.

Filmora analyzes audio and video files and replaces the existing audio with the newly selected audio file. Once the synchronization process is over, the new merged file will be available in the Media Panel for future processing.

The synchronized file will have the same terminology as the original video file with a difference. It will get an extension Merged to its name.

The original file will not get affected in Filmora. This software tool only references the files to generate a new file. The new file created when you add audio to the video can now be added to the timeline and exported.
