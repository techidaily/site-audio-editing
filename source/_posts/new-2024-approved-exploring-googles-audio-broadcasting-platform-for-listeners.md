## Part 1\. What is Google Podcast App?

![google podcast interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-1.jpg)

Google Podcast (formerly Google Play Podcast) is Google's proprietary podcast-listening app. It comes pre-installed on some Android smartphones and all Pixel editions. Even Apple users can install Google Podcasts via the App Store. It's free and lets you discover, stream, and download podcasts.

Google Podcast has already hit 100 million downloads, an indication of its rising popularity both among content creators and users. Users prefer it for its navigable, search-aligned, minimalist interface. And prominent podcast creators are focusing on the app to make their episodes accessible to millions of Android users.

## Part 2: Google Podcasts Features

Compatible with Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Blackberry, and ChromeOS, Google Podcast is relatively a novice compared to dedicated podcast services. Still, Google Podcast seamlessly incorporates nearly every feature one needs to listen to podcasts.

Search and Personalized Recommendations

![google podcast search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-2.jpg)

The most significant feature of Google Podcast is its algorithm-based recommendations that connect users with shows that suit their listening habits. As a new user, you might want to explore new topics and taste new concepts, and that's where Google Podcast will impress you. But even more than that, it will automatically recommend suitable podcasts depending on your interest and previous engagements with the platform.

Google Podcast app covers a plethora of podcasts, so you do not have to switch to other platforms to discover something new or topics you love.

Free and Ad-free Experience

![google podcast ad free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-3.jpg)

Google Podcast is completely free in a world where podcast platforms demand high charges for an ad-free and high-quality experience. All you need is a Google account to register and listen to anything available on the platform. In addition, podcast creators have to qualify to Google's standards before submitting the podcast on the forum, ensuring you will listen to the podcast in high quality.

Clean UI

![google podcast interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-4.jpg)

Whether you've used a podcast platform before or not, the Google Podcast platform will seem familiar. Once you sign up, the interface will welcome you with podcasts covering all genres arranged neatly in a grid view for convenience.

In line with simplicity, the Settings option in the Google Platform app is as basic as basic gets. Plus, it allows you to conveniently organize your subscriptions and downloads via the Library tab.

One more thing: although Google Podcast is primarily designed for Android users, its counterparts on other OS, like Apple, Web, and macOS, remain simple and easy to use.

Auto-downloads, Sleep Timer, and Seamless Switch Between Devices

![google podcast downloads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-5.jpg)

Google Podcast automatically downloads the podcasts you love and removes them after you've listened to the particular episodes.

Another significant characteristic of the Google Podcast platform is its intuitiveness. For instance, many podcast platforms do not automatically switch to the next episode, but you do not have to worry about such aspects with Google Podcast. You can also put a sleep timer.

Given that it's available on all primary OS, you can seamlessly switch from one device to another. Not to forget, you can search for the podcasts using Google search or your Voice Assitant.

## Part 3: How Does Google Podcast Work?

Now that you know the Google Podcast app and its features, here's how to use the platform. Assuming you have downloaded the Google Podcast platform on your device and signed in using your Google account, we will now show you how to search and start listening to podcasts on the platform:

##### Step1 Add Your Favorites

![google podcast favorites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-6.jpg)

Once you register on the Google Podcast platform, the app will ask you to explore popular shows or search for your favorites. Once you click on the Explore option, a new screen with categories listed will be shown in the top menu, like For You, News, Culture, Education, Comedy, Technology, and more. Tap on the categories to view the features of podcasts in each category.

##### Step2 Search Podcasts Manually

![google podcast search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-7.jpg)

Click on the Search icon and then start typing the name of the podcasts you follow to locate them quickly. Next, tap on the desired podcasts from the search results and scroll down to view individual episodes. Finally, you can click the Subscribe button to follow the channel. The Play icon allows you to listen to the episodes.

##### Step3 Controls in the Google Podcast app

![google podcast controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-8.jpg)

Once you play an episode on the Google Podcast platform, you will be taken to full-view mode. The Pause icon allows you to interrupt the episode. Plus, the 10 seconds rewind button allows you to go back and listen to something again.

Whereas the 30 seconds forward button will enable you to jump 30 seconds ahead in the episode, you can use this icon during the introduction or in-episode ads. The Speed icon lets you change the playback speed from 0.5x to 3x.

The "half-moon" icon allows you to set a sleep timer. And the "Info." icon allows you to read about the individual podcasts (if published by the creators). The "ellipsis" icon (three dots) enables you to mark the episode as played, so it will not recommend the particular episode again. And the share button allows you to share the episode with others.

##### Step4 Queues and Downloads menu in the Google Podcast App

![google podcast downloads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-9.jpg)

Once downloaded, you can access them via the three-lined icon from the bottom-right of the interface. Within the Library tab, you will also find the History tab, which allows you to access all the episodes you've previously listened to.

##### Step5 Settings in the Google Podcast platform

For instance, Auto-downloads allow you to control the quality of the downloads and when to download (like over mobile data or Wi-Fi).

Plus, you can choose when to auto-delete the episodes, like after a week, and so on. Other options like Playback allow you to decide whether to Auto-play the next episode or not.

## **Part 1\. How to Remove Drums From Any Song: 2 Easy Methods**

You’ve probably been there. Wanted to make a drum cover video of our favorite song, but did not know if a drumless version exists. You may have wondered whether there is a way to isolate and remove a drum track easily. Luckily, there are several drum extract free download tools that you can use to take the drums out of any song with just a few clicks. Tools like [Media.io](https://www.media.io/). [UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/), [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), and [LALAL.ai](https://www.lalal.ai/) are known to effectively remove drums from audio files. Let’s have a look at the techniques that you can use:

### **1\. Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App**

Using an online web app is one of the easiest ways to extract drums from your song tracks. This is a great approach for beginners or people who do not have production experience. Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files. It usually plays the following functions:

* Loading and editing audio
* Recording new tracks
* Mixing and applying effects
* Mastering
* Exporting finished mixes

After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.

![moises.ai](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG)

This makes it a great choice when removing drums from music on SoundCloud or the latest video of YouTube. Why would you try Moises.ai?

* **Cloud-based AI application** – Effectively extracts drums from any public media URL
* **User-friendly UI** – The platform is simple and easy to use for all experience levels
* **Keep Track of Progress** – The Moises.ai dashboard keeps a library of all songs you have isolated, allowing you to playback and download on-demand
* **Download Separate Files** – Once your original audio file has been separated, you can download the vocals, drums, beats, and bass files to your local PC
* **Free Version is Available** – Try out the service on the free version before committing your money

Although some tracks will not isolate the best with this web app, it gets the work done. Once you download the files, it is easy to bring the songs into DAW to play along. The process makes it simple to create drum covers fast that you can play along with other web mixers.

### **2\. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins**

For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.

![vst plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG)

With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:

* AudioSourceRe
* UNMIX Drums
* XTrax Stem 2
* Drum Extract

VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.

* 4k (cymbals)
* 90 Hz (kick drum)
* 150 Hz (snare drum)

Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.

Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files. It usually plays the following functions:

* Loading and editing audio
* Recording new tracks
* Mixing and applying effects
* Mastering
* Exporting finished mixes

After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.

![moises.ai](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG)

This makes it a great choice when removing drums from music on SoundCloud or the latest video of YouTube. Why would you try Moises.ai?

* **Cloud-based AI application** – Effectively extracts drums from any public media URL
* **User-friendly UI** – The platform is simple and easy to use for all experience levels
* **Keep Track of Progress** – The Moises.ai dashboard keeps a library of all songs you have isolated, allowing you to playback and download on-demand
* **Download Separate Files** – Once your original audio file has been separated, you can download the vocals, drums, beats, and bass files to your local PC
* **Free Version is Available** – Try out the service on the free version before committing your money

Although some tracks will not isolate the best with this web app, it gets the work done. Once you download the files, it is easy to bring the songs into DAW to play along. The process makes it simple to create drum covers fast that you can play along with other web mixers.

### **2\. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins**

For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.

![vst plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG)

With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:

* AudioSourceRe
* UNMIX Drums
* XTrax Stem 2
* Drum Extract

VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.

* 4k (cymbals)
* 90 Hz (kick drum)
* 150 Hz (snare drum)

Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.
