**AI Portrait – The best feature of Wondershare Filmora for gameplay editing**

The AI Portrait is a new add-on in Wondershare Filmora. It can easily remove video backgrounds without using a green screen or chroma key, allowing you to add borders, glitch effects, pixelated, noise, or segmentation video effects.

### Conclusion

Glass-breaking sound effects are a great way to give your video or project some real, dramatic flair. These sounds for free online. Do an internet search, and you'll come up with plenty of sites that offer them as downloads. Note that not all of those websites will be completely free; those that only provide their glass-breaking sounds for certain uses may charge a fee after using it more than a certain number of times.

Filmora is a video editing program that's simple enough for beginners but powerful enough to satisfy even the most advanced editors. With features like manual mode and glass-breaking sound effects, you can easily create videos. Hope this article helps you with collecting glass breaking/shattering sound effects and adding them into videos using Filmora.
