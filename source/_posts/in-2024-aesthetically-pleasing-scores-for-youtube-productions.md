The nicest part of using SoundCloud for background music is that the recordings seem more like actual music rather than a manufactured tune created for a promotional film.

### AudioBlocks

Music, sound effects, and clips are all available for royalty-free use at Audioblocks. Here on the platform, they offer over a hundred thousand tracks. Regrettably, it is no longer free.

However, the company provides an excellent deal: $149 for a year of unlimited downloads. That's a great deal when you realize you have access to tens of thousands of songs.

Users can narrow down their search to music that is just the perfect length for their content. That's a fantastic method to cut down on your editing efforts.

They include some intriguing subcategories for tracks, such as "hyena laugh sound effect," "canned laughter sound," "woman laughing sound effect," "which laugh sound effect," and so on, based on moods or feelings.

This is fantastic since you can quickly select music based on the content’s mood you want to convey.

## Part 2 Make Laughing Sound Effect by Yourself

Here is what you can do to create a sound effect by yourself. One way is to generate the sound effect by yourself.

For instance, if you want an evil laugh in mp3 format, you can ask your friends and relatives for a sample. It can even be a fun memory for both of you.

You can also record the laugh effect when you’re in a casual setting. Please note that the raw audio may not be usable without some significant editing to clean up ambient noise. This is where Wondershare’s Filmora comes into play.

## Audacity for Podcasts Recording Tutorial

Each of these mono channels will be blended into stereo when you export your podcast later.

There is nothing complicated about the actual recording procedure.

## In Audacity, here's how to export your podcast

After you've finished editing your podcast, listen to it one more time to ensure you're satisfied with the outcome, then save it to ensure you don't lose your work if anything goes wrong during the export process. When you export your podcast, you're creating an audio file that you can publish to your podcast host and share with others.

Here's how to export the Audacity podcast:

* Select File > Export > Export as... from the File menu.
* After giving your podcast a name, click Save.
* If you wish to add metadata, you may do so now, or just hit OK to begin the exporting process.
* This procedure may take a long time if the podcast is lengthy or your machine is sluggish. During this procedure, keep your computer turned on & prevent it from sleeping and hibernating.
* You're ready to publish your podcast to the podcast host once it's finished exporting.

## Conclusions

For recording, editing, & mixing your own podcast, an Audacity is a great option. And, like many podcasters, you could discover it meets your long-term requirements. With regard to voice effects, we talk about how people may use Filmora to modify and improve their voices. Filmora has the ability to re-speak video and audio, as well as previously recorded voiceovers. Video, audio, and voiceover files may all benefit from the Timeline's Pitch feature. Change the tonality of a video or recording to give it a unique sound. It's easy to replace the voices in the videos using Filmora. A video or narrative should accompany your viral in order for it to be effective. Changing Pitch allows you to alter the pitch of your voice. You may modify the pace of the video to alter the voice (Optional). Make a backup copy of the altered media.
