Filmora's Royalty-Free sound effects can even be used independently of the software. Just download the sound effects needed, like a cat mp3 sound effect, and use it in your video.

One pro when using Filmora is adding an audio track to a video clip. You can add another audio track at the end and keep overlaying.

This allows audio clips to be used in sync and creates rich aural cues that amp up the entertainment value of your video.
