Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>
<h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits-1"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits-1" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>

In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-1"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-1" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free-1"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free-1" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-1"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>

Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>

If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>

The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>

Furthermore, how long the upload is going to last depends on the size of the file, so it is advisable to choose a video that is small in size in order to avoid wasting a lot of time on waiting for the file to upload. Here’s how you can remove audio from videos online.</p>
<h4 id="2-AudioRemover"><a href="#2-AudioRemover" class="headerlink" title="2. AudioRemover"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.audioremover.com/" >AudioRemover <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>This platform offers a lot of video and audio editing tools for free, and it enables you to stabilize videos, change their size or to extract audio from video. The AudioRemover tool is quite simple to use, as you just have to click on the <strong>Browse button</strong> to select the video you’d like to upload and then click on the <strong>Upload Video button</strong> to start removing the audio from video. The entire process is automatic, so once the upload is over you can just click on the <strong>Download File link</strong> to save the new file to your computer. You can’t upload files larger than <strong>500MB</strong> to AudioRemover which can potentially reduce the number of options you have at your disposal. The platform replaces the entire audio of a video clip and it doesn’t allow you to remove only a part of the video’s original sound.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you would like to separate the audio from a video, the Audio-Extractor tool is one of the best options available on the Internet. You just have to <strong>upload a video file</strong> to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, <strong>select MP3, FLAC or OGG</strong> output audio format and click on the <strong>Extract Audio button</strong>. You can then save the audio file on <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing"><a href="#4-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/mute-video" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

<p>Kapwing is an online video editing platform that lets you add text or music to videos, change the playback speed of a video or create memes and stop-motion animations. The Mute Video tool reduces the video’s audio volume to zero automatically, which for all practical purposes is the same as removing an audio file from a video. After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the <strong>Create button</strong>. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the <strong>Download button</strong> to save the video to your computer or the <strong>Edit button</strong> if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again. All tools on the Kapwing platform are free, but the <strong>videos you mute will be watermarked</strong> unless you pay a small fee to remove the watermark.</p>

<p>The wide range of supported audio and video formats make this platform a reliable option for anyone who wants to extract an audio file from a video or remove the original audio from the video completely. Click on the <strong>Choose File button</strong> and then select either <strong>Remove Sound or Extract Sound</strong> option. If you want to <strong>Extract Sound</strong> the platform lets you choose from <strong>MP3, iPhone ringtone or wav</strong> output audio file formats. Click on the <strong>Upload&amp;Convert</strong> button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive. However, the platform requests your <strong>mobile phone number</strong> before you can download a file and it <strong>displays ads</strong> after you click on the <strong>Download button</strong>, which can be quite frustrating if you want to remove audio from a video clip quickly.</p>
<h4 id="6-Using-YouTube-to-Remove-Audio-From-Videos"><a href="#6-Using-YouTube-to-Remove-Audio-From-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Using YouTube to Remove Audio From Videos"></a>6. Using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Remove Audio From Videos</h4><p>Although YouTube is not famous for its video or audio editing tools, you can still remove audio from videos in the platform’s <strong>Creator Studio</strong>. Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the <strong>Creator Studio’s Video tab</strong>. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the <strong>Audio tab</strong>, that is located at the top of the screen next to <strong>Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs</strong>. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the <strong>Featured Tracks</strong> option to <strong>Ambient</strong> and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The <strong>Favor Original Audio</strong> slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. <strong>Drag the slider all the way to the right</strong> in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on <strong>the Position Audio option</strong> to gain access to <strong>the audio waveform</strong>. <strong>Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second</strong> and the video will no longer have sound. <strong>This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero</strong>, which is why it is important to <strong>carefully set the duration of the new audio track</strong> you added to the video. Click on the <strong>Save as New Video option</strong> to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you. The only downside is that you have to mute the entire video since none of the platforms featured in this article allows you to choose the section of a video you’d like to mute.

The platform replaces the entire audio of a video clip and it doesn’t allow you to remove only a part of the video’s original sound.</p>

<p>If you would like to separate the audio from a video, the Audio-Extractor tool is one of the best options available on the Internet. You just have to <strong>upload a video file</strong> to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, <strong>select MP3, FLAC or OGG</strong> output audio format and click on the <strong>Extract Audio button</strong>. You can then save the audio file on <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.</p>

<p>Kapwing is an online video editing platform that lets you add text or music to videos, change the playback speed of a video or create memes and stop-motion animations. The Mute Video tool reduces the video’s audio volume to zero automatically, which for all practical purposes is the same as removing an audio file from a video. After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the <strong>Create button</strong>. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the <strong>Download button</strong> to save the video to your computer or the <strong>Edit button</strong> if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again. All tools on the Kapwing platform are free, but the <strong>videos you mute will be watermarked</strong> unless you pay a small fee to remove the watermark.</p>

<p>The wide range of supported audio and video formats make this platform a reliable option for anyone who wants to extract an audio file from a video or remove the original audio from the video completely. Click on the <strong>Choose File button</strong> and then select either <strong>Remove Sound or Extract Sound</strong> option. If you want to <strong>Extract Sound</strong> the platform lets you choose from <strong>MP3, iPhone ringtone or wav</strong> output audio file formats. Click on the <strong>Upload&amp;Convert</strong> button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive. However, the platform requests your <strong>mobile phone number</strong> before you can download a file and it <strong>displays ads</strong> after you click on the <strong>Download button</strong>, which can be quite frustrating if you want to remove audio from a video clip quickly.</p>

Using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Remove Audio From Videos</h4><p>Although YouTube is not famous for its video or audio editing tools, you can still remove audio from videos in the platform’s <strong>Creator Studio</strong>. Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the <strong>Creator Studio’s Video tab</strong>. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the <strong>Audio tab</strong>, that is located at the top of the screen next to <strong>Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs</strong>. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the <strong>Featured Tracks</strong> option to <strong>Ambient</strong> and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The <strong>Favor Original Audio</strong> slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. <strong>Drag the slider all the way to the right</strong> in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on <strong>the Position Audio option</strong> to gain access to <strong>the audio waveform</strong>. <strong>Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second</strong> and the video will no longer have sound. <strong>This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero</strong>, which is why it is important to <strong>carefully set the duration of the new audio track</strong> you added to the video. Click on the <strong>Save as New Video option</strong> to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you. The only downside is that you have to mute the entire video since none of the platforms featured in this article allows you to choose the section of a video you’d like to mute.

<p>The raw footage produced by all digital cameras contains sound, but more often than not the quality of the audio captured by a camera microphone is underwhelming. Editing a video demands time and access to a powerful video editing app, such as Final Cut Pro or Vegas Pro. In case you don’t have the necessary skills to edit a video using Mac or PC based video editing apps or you simply don’t have enough time to go through the audio editing process, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best online solutions that let you <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove audio from a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> effortlessly.</p>
