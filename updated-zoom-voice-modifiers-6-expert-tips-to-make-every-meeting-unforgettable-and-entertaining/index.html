And as a result, the audiobook industry has now become very profitable.</p>
<p>Apart from the popularity, the cost of making an audiobook from an existing book is comparatively on the lower side. Therefore, the profit of converting books into audiobooks is pretty high.</p>
<h4 id="2-Larger-audience-2"><a href="#2-Larger-audience-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Larger audience"></a>2.Larger audience</h4><p>Audiobooks comparatively have a larger audience. The audience of audiobooks is not limited to those who are capable of reading. For example, a person with low or blind vision cannot read an eBook, but he can effortlessly listen to an audiobook. Likewise, an audiobook takes your piece of writing to a completely different and larger group of audience.</p>
<h4 id="3-No-worries-about-stock-2"><a href="#3-No-worries-about-stock-2" class="headerlink" title="3.No worries about stock"></a>3.No worries about stock</h4><p>When publishing a physical book, you have to constantly worry about keeping the print in stock and meeting readers’ demands. You can avoid such worries when you opt for audiobooks. In the case of audiobooks, there always exists a file accessible for readers to download and read.</p>
<h4 id="4-Easy-discovery-2"><a href="#4-Easy-discovery-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Easy discovery"></a>4.Easy discovery</h4><p>Your book will become easily discoverable when you publish it in the version of an audiobook also. Printed books are comparatively least discoverable online unless they have an audiobook version. The more discoverable your book is, the more is its reach to the targeted audience.</p>
<h4 id="5-Save-on-time-and-expenses-2"><a href="#5-Save-on-time-and-expenses-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Save on time and expenses"></a>5.Save on time and expenses</h4><p>The creation of audiobooks is comparatively easy and low in cost.

Now the question is how to make an audiobook effortlessly. There are actually two ways in which you can create an audiobook.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can get the professional help of an audiobook production company.</li>
<li>Record the audiobook yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>At first thought, you may feel like recording the audiobook yourself will help you save the cost of the process. But actually, recording the audiobook yourself will be more expensive in terms of money and time.</p>
<p>Anyways, let us see the basic steps of the creation of an audiobook.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Step One:**Prepare the contents of your book for recording. If it is an eBook, better delete the hyperlinks, visuals, and call to action that may cause distractions to the narrator. Ensure that the content or script can be easily read and makes some sense when listened to as an audiobook.</li>
<li>**Step Two:**Find a narrator. It can be yourself or someone hired for the purpose. You can actually hire an audiobook narrator for the purpose. Surprisingly, audiobook narrators are super-affordable, and they will get the task done effortlessly.</li>
<li>**Step Three:**Get the audio files recorded by the narrator mastered or edited by an audiobook producer to ensure the quality of the final production file. You can do it yourself if your technical knowledge is sound and good enough.</li>
<li><strong>Step Four:</strong> Now, the last step is uploading your audiobook into ACX or Audiobook Creation Exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is how an audiobook is created. By uploading on ACX, you can make your audiobook available and discoverable on most audiobook platforms, including Amazon, Apple audiobook store, and Audible.</p>
<p>You have to open an account on ACX to upload your audiobook. An ACX account can be easily created by entering your Amazon account and tax details. After signing up, you have to choose whether you need an exclusive publication or a non-exclusive publication for your audiobook.</p>
<p>Exclusive publication of your audiobook allows you to get a higher commission or royalty share of 40%. But your audiobook won’t be published on other competing sites. In contrast, your audiobook will get published on multiple sites if you choose a non-exclusive publication. But the royalty share reduces to just 25%. That’s all about ACX.</p>
<p>Now let us see how to make an audiobook of your own.</p>

It has been there for as long as we can remember. We tend to connect to a particular kind of DJ. Of all the different genres, most of the artists and genres are inspired by Rock n’ Roll. Party background music adds life to all the stories and moments. But where and how to get it?? Let’s find out.</p>

<p>Regardless of age and favourite genre, we all enjoy a good DJ. There’s this magic about good tunes, sound and connectivity; electronic background music makes us go gaga.</p>
<p>Are you also on the lookout for electronic background music? Do you want to build a rocking collection without spending much? With the abundance of resources on the internet, DJs have a vast opportunity to discover and download sounds for free. Let’s have a look-</p>
<h3 id="Streaming-Platforms"><a href="#Streaming-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Platforms"></a>Streaming Platforms</h3><p>Many sites have enormous libraries for DJs to create DJ background music. But today, these are replaced by the most fantastic streaming services like Spotify and Apple music.</p>
<p>You can hunt for DJ songs on these, but you’ll have to download the files from another service if you do not have a compatible DJ programme. But these days, even these platforms are finding their way into DJ software.</p>
<p>The easier and best way is to explore the playlists that already exist on these apps. This way, you can discover new songs for DJ’s based on the listening trends of the audience.</p>
<p>For example, apple music has playlists for nearly every genre, allowing you to keep updated with the latest tunes. Spotify’s daily playlists are genre-based, and a fantastic blend of previously listened to songs and new tracks to compliment!</p>
