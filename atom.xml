Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p><h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p><h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p><p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p><h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Let’s have a look at the techniques that you can use:</p><h3 id="1-Extract-Drums-from-a-Song-Online-With-A-Web-App"><a href="#1-Extract-Drums-from-a-Song-Online-With-A-Web-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App"></a><strong>1. Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App</strong></h3><p>Using an online web app is one of the easiest ways to extract drums from your song tracks. This is a great approach for beginners or people who do not have production experience. Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files. It usually plays the following functions:</p><ul><li>Loading and editing audio</li><li>Recording new tracks</li><li>Mixing and applying effects</li><li>Mastering</li><li>Exporting finished mixes</li></ul><p>After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take <a class="link"   href="https://moises.ai/" >Moises.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG"                      alt="moises.ai"                ></p><p>This makes it a great choice when removing drums from music on SoundCloud or the latest video of YouTube. Why would you try Moises.ai?</p><ul><li><strong>Cloud-based AI application</strong> – Effectively extracts drums from any public media URL</li><li><strong>User-friendly UI</strong> – The platform is simple and easy to use for all experience levels</li><li><strong>Keep Track of Progress</strong> – The Moises.ai dashboard keeps a library of all songs you have isolated, allowing you to playback and download on-demand</li><li><strong>Download Separate Files</strong> – Once your original audio file has been separated, you can download the vocals, drums, beats, and bass files to your local PC</li><li><strong>Free Version is Available</strong> – Try out the service on the free version before committing your money</li></ul><p>Although some tracks will not isolate the best with this web app, it gets the work done. Once you download the files, it is easy to bring the songs into DAW to play along. The process makes it simple to create drum covers fast that you can play along with other web mixers.</p><h3 id="2-Extract-Drums-from-a-Song-Online-with-VST-Plugins"><a href="#2-Extract-Drums-from-a-Song-Online-with-VST-Plugins" class="headerlink" title="2. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins"></a><strong>2. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins</strong></h3><p>For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG"                      alt="vst plugins"                ></p><p>With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:</p><ul><li>AudioSourceRe</li><li>UNMIX Drums</li><li>XTrax Stem 2</li><li>Drum Extract</li></ul><p>VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.</p><ul><li>4k (cymbals)</li><li>90 Hz (kick drum)</li><li>150 Hz (snare drum)</li></ul><p>Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Edit-Drums-in-Audio-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Edit-Drums-in-Audio-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free. That’s why, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online tools that allow you to separate audio from video files in just a few easy steps.</p><h2 id="Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors"><a href="#Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Online Audio Extractors"></a>Top 6 Online Audio Extractors</h2><p>The limitations in terms of size and file format can narrow down your choices of online audio extractors.

AudioExtracter</h4><p>This platform enables you to convert video files to audio files <strong>automatically</strong>, but it also offers a variety of <strong>video, photo and audio editing tools</strong> you can use free of charge. You just have to upload a file, in <strong>MP4, AVI</strong> or any other commonly used video file formats, that is smaller than <strong>500mb</strong> and AudioExtracter will convert your video into an MP3 audio file you can save to your computer. The only downside is that you can’t choose an <strong>output format, readjust the bitrate and select the quality of the audio file</strong> you are creating, which can significantly restrict your options. The platform also offers a new feature that enables you to <strong>convert YouTube videos into MP3 files,</strong> so that you can save all your favorite songs as audio files on your computer.</p><h4 id="4-Online-Video-Converter"><a href="#4-Online-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="4.

Yes, while the animation is still ruling the floor, an inevitable back-end process might look off-screen and a little complicated. One such job is <strong>ducking sound</strong> that is the process of balancing voiceover and the background audio. If you aren’t a tech-savvy person, I hope to go in-depth isn’t needed, and hence we stop here. To depict how you need to work out this <strong>ducking music</strong> process, we have this post.</p><p>If you are a content creator, maybe you will be familiar with coordinating the right audio with the video. If not, it isn’t a problem anymore as I have included a detailed guide of implementing <strong>audio ducking</strong> in a step-wise way. With primary importance to the popular software <strong>OBS</strong> followed by a suitable alternative, let’s begin our article!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Balance-Your-Stream-Sound-with-OBS-Audio-Ducking"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Balance-Your-Stream-Sound-with-OBS-Audio-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?"></a>Part 1: How to Balance Your Stream Sound with OBS Audio Ducking?</h2><p><strong>OBS</strong> (Open Broadcaster Software) is free and open-source software reliable for Windows, Linux, and macOS 10.13+. With countless features like real video&#x2F;audio capture, mixer, custom transitions, easy-to-use configurations, pre-source filters, VST plug-in support, noise suppression, and a lot more, you can accomplish audio ducking in OBS by adding a sidechain&#x2F;ducking compression filter. Thus, perform OBS audio ducking in a clean manner by lowering the audio automatically once OBS detects audio on the other audio source.</p><p>Does this magic of OBS audio ducking seem new to you? It will not be anymore as the below step-by-step manual will guide you through the process.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add video files</strong></p><p>Launch the OBS software on your system, and import the files into the workspace with the “File” menu. If you need to add voiceover from your microphone, you can click the “Start Recording” option under the main interface’s control section.</p><p>If the video plays on VLC in the background, it will appear on the mixer column.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose filter and compressor</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Settings</strong> icon next to the streaming video, click on it, and choose the “Filters” option from the drop-down.</p><p>You will reach the pop-up of the “Filters for Desktop Audio” whereby clicking on the “+” icon, choose the compressor option.</p><p>On the space bar, enter a name for the filter. For example, for <strong>ducking music</strong>, specify as “ducking,” and press “OK.”</p><p><strong>Step 3: Change the parameters</strong></p><p>You can now specify the values of the ratio, threshold, attack, release, output gain, and the ducking source, for example, “Mic” for microphone voiceover addition.</p><p>It’s complete. Yes, OBS audio ducking is over. Now you can check the video and alter the parameters if required after a preview.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Audio-Ducking-Alternative-to-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Audio-Ducking-Alternative-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Audio Ducking Alternative to OBS"></a>Part 2: The Best Audio Ducking Alternative to OBS</h2><p>Although OBS is preferable for being an open-source and free option with comprehensive abilities in video recording and live streaming strategies, the OBS ducking interface might seem a little unfriendly, making it difficult for newbies. Hence, we have come up with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this session as the best alternative to Streamlabs OBS audio ducking.

While you might know about the Audio Clip Mixer, which lets you take on the audio between clips, the Audio Track Mixer allows you to control a whole track, which can be beneficial in its own way. Sometimes you need to make big sweeping changes that affect everything, and no one wants to change their all sounds clip by clip, which is where the track mixer comes in handy.</p><p>So how do you use the audio track mixer to manage your audio inside of a video?

For instance, when you watch a TV show and have music cut over two characters talking, that’s an example of mixed tracks. You can mix music, dialogue, sound effects, voiceovers, and other things to create a seamless finished product. You can even have different types of audio, or have different tracks play in different earphones of the headset if you want to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-track-mixer-overview.jpg"                      alt="Audio Track Mixer overview"                ></p><p>With audio track mixer, you can see each track being played in real time, not just on the timeline but also on its own screen.

Dealing with tracks, especially when you have several of them running on top of one another, can be a frustrating process of clicking and straining your ears to ensure that everything is just perfect.</p><p>Instead of wasting hours staring at the computer screen, using the Audio Track Mixer in Premiere Pro is a great way to cut down on the micromanagement and instead focus on what’s really important - getting a good quality sound out of your video and audio.</p><p>Use the track mixer to manage and customize your sounds, see the volume and base of each individual track in real time, and set when tracks come in and fade out. Using the mixer will allow you to have picture perfect sound quality, every single time.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you want to edit audio in an easier way, here we recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The popularity of beat edits has gone through the roof in the era of social media videos, as so many YouTubers and video content creators produce videos that are perfectly synced to the music. This video editing technique can be used in a single scene or throughout an entire video, depending on the project and the effect you would like the video to make on the viewer. Read on if you would like to learn how to edit video clips to match the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><h2 id="How-to-Edit-and-Auto-Sync-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Edit-and-Auto-Sync-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?"></a>How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?</h2><p> Before you start editing clips to the beat, you must first ensure that all of the materials you want to include in that video are imported into the project you created in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once the footage you intend to use in your video is in the Media Bin, you should head over to the <strong>New</strong> submenu in the <strong>File menu</strong>.</p><p> Afterward, you can add an audio file to the timeline and ensure that the sequence settings are correct. The audio file is going to serve as the core around which you are going to build the entire video, which is why it is important to select a rhythmic song that has clearly distinguishable beats.</p><p> Click on the <strong>Wrench icon</strong> and choose the <strong>Show Audio Waveform</strong> option from the drop-down menu, so that you can see the beats in the audio file. Make sure that the sequence you created is selected and not the audio file you added to the timeline and then position the playhead at the beginning of the song. Listening to the music to which you would like to edit your video a few times is recommended because it will enable you to better understand where the beats are located.</p><p> When ready start adding markers to the sequence by using the <strong>M keyboard shortcut</strong>, so that every beat of the song contains a marker. This may take a few tries because hitting the beats can be difficult for video editors that don’t have any musical talents, but with practice, you should be able to position the markers precisely where they need to be. Also, you can make the adjustments to the video you’re creating after you sync your footage with the audio so even if the markers aren’t positioned perfectly you can make corrections later.</p><p> Head over to the Media Bin and proceed to add <strong>In and Out points</strong>, by either clicking on their icons or using the <strong>I and O buttons</strong>, to all video clips you want to edit to the beat. By doing so you will let Adobe Premiere know which parts of the video clips you want to keep and where it should create cuts. After setting the In and Out points for all the video clips you would like to use in your project you just have to select them. The order in which your footage is selected is important as it will determine where they are going to be placed on the timeline.</p><p> Choose the <strong>Automate to Sequence</strong> option from the <strong>Clip menu</strong> and once the Automate to Sequence window appears on the screen you should choose the <strong>Selection Order</strong> option from the <strong>Ordering menu</strong>. Afterward, you should select the <strong>At Unnumbered Markers</strong> setting from the <strong>Placement menu</strong> and change the <strong>Method to the Overwrite Edit.</strong></p><p> Make sure that the <strong>Use In&#x2F;Out Range</strong> option is enabled and click on the <strong>Ignore Audio</strong> checkbox if your video clips also contain audio. Click OK to confirm the changes and Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically match your footage to the markers you added to the sequence.</p><h2 id="How-to-Edit-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-with-BeatEdit-Extension-for-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Edit-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-with-BeatEdit-Extension-for-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit Video Clips to the Beat of a Song with BeatEdit Extension for Adobe Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Edit Video Clips to the Beat of a Song with BeatEdit Extension for Adobe Premiere Pro?</h2><p> Placing markers at each beat in the song can be both difficult and time-consuming, which defeats the purpose of using Adobe Premiere Pro to automate this process. In case you are looking to save some time on adding markers to a sequence, you should try the Mamoworld’s <a class="link"   href="https://mamoworld.com/tools/beatedit-premiere-pro" >BeatEdit extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Adobe Premiere Pro that analyses the music and adds markers automatically. Here’s how you can edit video clips to match the beat with BeatEdit.</p><p><strong>How to Edit Footage to the Beat in Premiere Pro with the BeatEdit Extension?</strong></p><p> In order to download and install the BeatEdit in Adobe Premiere Pro, you must pay a one-time $99,99 fee. After you go through the installation process, you can launch BeatEdit from the <strong>Extensions submenu</strong> that is located in the Window menu.</p><p> After the BeatEdit window pops up on the screen you should click on the <strong>Load Music</strong> button in order to start the beat detection process. After the audio file is analyzed blue lines are going to be displayed at each beat and you’ll be able to hear a click sound if you play the song. BeatEdit lets you adjust the volume of the audio file you analyzed and enables you to select the beats where you want to make the cuts in your footage.</p><p> You can choose if you want to select beats evenly or randomly, specify their frequency or select the portion of the song from which you want to select the beats. The extension also lets you add extra markers that are not located at beat and adjust their amount or minimum distance. BeatEdit generates clip and sequence markers, so make sure that the sequence markers option is selected before clicking on the <strong>Create Markers</strong> button.</p><p> Add the audio file you would like to use in your video to the Adobe Premiere Pro’s timeline and proceed to select the video clips in the Media Bin. Place the playhead at the beginning of the timeline and select the Automate to Sequence option from the Clip menu. You can then select the same settings you’d select if you added the markers to the sequence on your own.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Editing videos to the beat of a song in Premiere Pro is becoming increasingly popular among video content creators. Hopefully, our tutorial has helped you learn this simple but effective video editing technique so that you can use it to make the videos your friends and followers on social media are going to enjoy watching. It is important to remember that how effective your beat edits are going to be, depends on the quality of the footage and the song selection.
