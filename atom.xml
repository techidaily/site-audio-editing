A good soundtrack can drastically increase the overall quality of a video since barely audible dialogues or background noises distract a viewer. Even adding simple effects like fade in or fade out can make a huge difference in how well a video is accepted by your friends on social media. If you would like to learn how to fade audio in your videos, you’re at the right place, because in this article we are going to show you how to fade in or fade out an audio clip.</p><h2 id="Fading-Audio-in-Adobe-Rush-1"><a href="#Fading-Audio-in-Adobe-Rush-1" class="headerlink" title="Fading Audio in Adobe Rush"></a>Fading Audio in Adobe Rush</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" >Adobe Rush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that was released a short while ago doesn’t seem to be living up to the high standard we can commonly expect from Adobe’s products.

Import video and audio files into Filmora</h4><p>Most video clips contain an audio track, but in some cases, you might want to remove the clip’s original audio and replace it with music, narration, dialogue or atmospheric sounds you choose. You can import an audio file into Filmora by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and selecting the Import Media Files option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-media-panel.JPG"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148619/17108" target="_top" id="2148619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2148619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="100" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148619/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Alternatively, you can just drag and drop an audio file from the folder to the Media Panel. Filmora also features a rich library of royalty-free music you can use to select a soundtrack for your video. Drag and drop the video or audio file into the timeline from the Media Panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-audio-track.JPG"                                     ></p><h4 id="2-Fading-audio-in-Filmora"><a href="#2-Fading-audio-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="2.

Fading audio in Filmora</h4><p><strong>Method 1: With Audio panel</strong></p><p>Clicking on the Edit button, located at the end of the software’s toolbar will grant you the access to the software’s audio panel where you can easily adjust the volume of the clip, select one of Equalizer presets or change the Pitch of the audio file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-audio-panel.JPG"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997657/19272" target="_top" id="1997657">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997657" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997657/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Fade in and Fade out sliders are located at the top of the Audio panel and you can drag the handle on the slider or you can insert new Fade in or Fade out values manually in the boxes next to the sliders. You can click play and decide if you like the effect you created before you click OK to confirm the changes.</p><p><strong>Method 2: Directly from Timeline</strong></p><p>In case you want to fade an audio quickly you can do so directly from the timeline. Just click on the handle at the beginning or the end of the audio file and then drag it to adjust the duration of the effect. Both of Fade in or Fade out handles can be easily moved directly on the timeline, even if you set their values from the Audio Panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fading-audio-in-filmora-9-timeline.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027195/19272" target="_top" id="2027195">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027195" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027195/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Filmora features a lot of sound effects, like the Phone Ring, Explosion or Car Horn that can be combined with the Fade in or Fade out effect to create a better soundtrack for your video. When ready, click on the Export button and proceed to choose the video’s resolution, file format or export destination. The software also lets you export MP3 files, which enables you to save all the changes you make while editing an audio file.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Even though Adobe Rush is an app aimed at YouTubers and social media video creators, fading in or out of an audio is still not an option. On the other hand, fading an audio in Filmora is a quick and simple process. Gradually introducing a new music theme or slowly fading the sound as a scene ends can make a social media video sound more professional, and it can help content creators to transition from one scene to the other more smoothly.

Every <strong>audio format</strong> that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.</p><p>In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:</p><ul><li>Uncompressed Audio Format</li><li>Lossless Compressed Audio Format</li><li>Lossy Compressed Audio Format</li></ul><p>Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896546/19272" target="_top" id="1896546">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896546" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896546/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Uncompressed-Audio-Format"><a href="#1-Uncompressed-Audio-Format" class="headerlink" title="1. Uncompressed Audio Format"></a>1. Uncompressed Audio Format</h3><p>Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.</p><p>Some sound files that fall under this category include:</p><h4 id="1-Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM"><a href="#1-Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM" class="headerlink" title="1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)"></a>1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)</h4><p> A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.</p><h4 id="2-Waveform-Audio-File-Format-WAV"><a href="#2-Waveform-Audio-File-Format-WAV" class="headerlink" title="2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)"></a>2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)</h4><p> Generally used on the Windows platform, this <strong>audio format</strong> is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.</p><p><em>You may also interest: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube to WAV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="3-Audio-Interchange-File-Format-AIFF"><a href="#3-Audio-Interchange-File-Format-AIFF" class="headerlink" title="3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)"></a>3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)</h4><p>AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.</p><p><em>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best AIFF to MP3 Converters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="4-Data-Stream-Digital-DSD"><a href="#4-Data-Stream-Digital-DSD" class="headerlink" title="4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)"></a>4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)</h4><p>Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Lossless-Compressed-Audio-Format"><a href="#2-Lossless-Compressed-Audio-Format" class="headerlink" title="2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format"></a>2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format</h3><p>Lossless Compressed <strong>audio format</strong> is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.</p><p>Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:</p><h4 id="1-Free-Lossless-Audio-Code-FLAC"><a href="#1-Free-Lossless-Audio-Code-FLAC" class="headerlink" title="1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)"></a>1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)</h4><p>At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free <strong>audio format</strong>, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.</p><p><em>Check some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best FLAC editor programs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="2-Apple-Lossless-Audio-Codec-ALAC"><a href="#2-Apple-Lossless-Audio-Codec-ALAC" class="headerlink" title="2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)"></a>2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)</h4><p>Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.</p><h3 id="3-Lossy-Compressed-Audio-Format"><a href="#3-Lossy-Compressed-Audio-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format"></a>3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format</h3><p>These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.</p><p>Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:</p><h4 id="1-MPEG-1-Audio-Layer-3-MP3"><a href="#1-MPEG-1-Audio-Layer-3-MP3" class="headerlink" title="1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)"></a>1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)</h4><p>This is one of the most common file types and the <strong>best audio format</strong> for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the <strong>best audio file format</strong> is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.</p><p><em>Check this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >MP3 editor and convert video to MP3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> easily.</em></p><h4 id="2-OGG"><a href="#2-OGG" class="headerlink" title="2) OGG"></a>2) OGG</h4><p>This one, again, is not in fact an <strong>audio format</strong> but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.</p><h4 id="3-AU"><a href="#3-AU" class="headerlink" title="3) AU"></a>3) AU</h4><p>AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.</p><p>What’s the difference between common audio file formats like MP3,  WAV, and FLAC?

Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:</p><ul><li><strong>Uncompressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.</p><ul><li><strong>Lossless Compressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed <strong>audio format</strong> would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.</p><ul><li><strong>Compressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an <strong>audio format</strong> that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the <strong>best audio format</strong> that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Audio-File-Formats-Does-YouTube-Support"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Audio-File-Formats-Does-YouTube-Support" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?"></a>Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?</h2><p>At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files.

Scheduled for March 19, the bare metal vs. raw power event is set to become a must-watch experience of the annual CloudFest conference.</p><p> According to the dedicated event page,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/39-year-old-477-mhz-dos-web-server-hits-2500-hours-of-uptime" >server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> throwing began in Holland about a decade ago and is an “intense underground sport, which has been criticized as ‘needlessly brutal to servers’.” This sport is now emerging from its data-center basement origins and is set to enter the world stage at CloudFest 2024.</p><p> CloudFest provides a few details regarding the 2024 World Server Throwing Championship. This outdoor event in front of a live audience will welcome “up to 40 server-throwing athletes.” All genders and ability levels are welcome to participate as long as they desire to throw a server a great distance. Every athlete will get two measured attempts at server throwing and will hope to be placed in the top three so they can win a prize.</p><p> Though the sport is brutal by its very nature, it is good to see that participants at previous events always wear gloves. Some servers have very sharp edges. If you plan to attend, it might be wise to stand behind participants rather than to the left or right in case of server hurling misjudgment.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> It isn’t clear if there are 1U, 2U, and 4U divisions, or, dare we say it, 8U for the real heavy lifters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtmZvaBCUd7W2J88EkoF6b-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Server throwing athletes"                ></p><p> (Image credit: CloudFest)</p><p> If we had to place a bet on the winner’s nationality, it would probably be Dutch, as the country where the sport seems to have become established. We discovered that some of the WTSC partners have already promoted server throwing in Dutch events. The winner of a Dutch national championship event<a class="link"   href="https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/agenda/summer-bbq-dutch-cloud-community-2022/" >in 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> managed to fling a 10kg+ (22 pounds +) server 12.23 meters (over 40 feet).</p><p> We think there is plenty of room for improvement on the 2022 winning throw. Remember, the world record distance for throwing a 16-pound shot put is nearly 75 feet. For another comparison, in the Swedish sport of Stångstörtning, a roughly 57-pound log is tossed, with the world record distance being 32 feet.

In nutshell, it is a process in which the background sound of a clip is reduced and the voiceover is amplified. Therefore, with the help of sound ducking, we can focus on the dialogues without a noisy background track.</p><p>Lately, a lot of people have asked us about the process to do automatic audio ducking in <strong>Final Cut Pro X</strong>. Since it is a clip-based editing tool, it lacks a dedicated mixer to help us do FCPX audio ducking. Thankfully, there are third-party plugins and tools (like the <strong>FCPX AutoDuck</strong>) that can help us do the same. In this post, I will let you know how to do audio ducking in Final Cut Pro and its best alternative.</p><p>If you don’t want to use any plugins, see this article: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to sync in FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Perform-Audio-Ducking-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Perform-Audio-Ducking-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Perform Audio Ducking in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 1: How to Perform Audio Ducking in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>If you have a video in which you have background music and a voiceover, then you can perform sound ducking in it. This will automatically enhance the quality of the voiceover and would mellow down the background music selectively. Sadly, the feature of audio ducking in Final Cut Pro has to be done manually as there are no instant automatic options in the tool presently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-1.jpg"                      alt="Audio Ducking Process"                ></p><p>Therefore, you can use any reliable third-party FCPX tool like Audified or AutoDuck to meet your requirements. For instance, let’s consider the example of FCPX AutoDuck, which is a paid macOS application. To perform FCPX audio ducking, you first have to export the music and voiceover as two dedicated files. Later, you can import them to FCPX AutoDuck to perform auto-ducking of the music.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Export-the-Music-Files"><a href="#Step-1-Export-the-Music-Files" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Export the Music Files"></a>Step 1: Export the Music Files</h4><p>To perform audio ducking in Final Cut Pro, you can first launch the application on Mac and open your project. Since there is no FCPX audio ducking option, you first have to export the music files.</p><p>For this, you can just go to the main menu on Final Cut Pro and select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Share</strong> &gt; <strong>Master File</strong>. This will help you explore and save all the media files from Final Cut Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-2.jpg"                      alt="Final Cut Pro Master Files"                ></p><p>Now, once the Master File window would be opened, you can go to the “Role” tab and select “Audio Only” as the output role. This will display a list of the background music and the voiceover file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-3.jpg"                      alt="Export Audio Tracks"                ></p><p>You can now select the files of your choice and click on the “Next” button to save them to any desired location on your Mac.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Use-FCPX-AutoDuck-to-Do-Automatic-Sound-Ducking"><a href="#Step-2-Use-FCPX-AutoDuck-to-Do-Automatic-Sound-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Use FCPX AutoDuck to Do Automatic Sound Ducking"></a>Step 2: Use FCPX AutoDuck to Do Automatic Sound Ducking</h4><p>Great! Now, you can just open the FCPX AutoDuck application on your Mac via its Application or Spotlight. You can just give it a project name and drag-and-drop the speaker (voiceover) and the music files here. If you want, you can also import a filler file of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-4.jpg"                      alt="FCPX AutoDuck Process"                ></p><p>FCPX will also let you select the level of music ducking from its dedication option. There are also different options to set up things like setting up the window or pre-roll for the audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-5.jpg"                      alt="FCPS AutoDuck Options"                ></p><p>In the end, you can click on the “Duck” button and let FCPX AutoDuck perform automatic audio ducking on the files.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Insert-the-Modified-File-to-your-Project"><a href="#Step-3-Insert-the-Modified-File-to-your-Project" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Insert the Modified File to your Project"></a>Step 3: Insert the Modified File to your Project</h4><p>Once the FCPX audio ducking process is completed, it will generate an XML file. You can now just drag the XML file and drop it to your project in Final Cut Pro. Here, you can choose to select the XML file in the same project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx-6.jpg"                      alt="Import XML in Final Cut Pro"                ></p><p>You can now copy the modified music clip, go to the timeline, and paste it at the starting of the video.

Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins"></a><strong>2. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins</strong></h3><p>For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG"                      alt="vst plugins"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144278/7443" target="_top" id="2144278">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144278" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144278/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:</p><ul><li>AudioSourceRe</li><li>UNMIX Drums</li><li>XTrax Stem 2</li><li>Drum Extract</li></ul><p>VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.</p><ul><li>4k (cymbals)</li><li>90 Hz (kick drum)</li><li>150 Hz (snare drum)</li></ul><p>Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Edit-Drums-in-Audio-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Edit-Drums-in-Audio-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
