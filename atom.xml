Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p><h2 id="Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021"><a href="#Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021"></a>Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021</h2><p>Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.</p><h3 id="1-Google-App"><a href="#1-Google-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Google App"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US" >Google App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.</p><p>Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.</p><p>This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:</p><p>Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.</p><p>Step 2- Either click on the “Search a song” button or say “what’s this song?” before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That’s it. That’s all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.</p><p>It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, “Hey Google, what’s this song?” before humming the tune, and that’s about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.</p><p>And don’t worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.</p><h3 id="2-Shazam"><a href="#2-Shazam" class="headerlink" title="2. Shazam"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android" >Shazam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Shazam music recognition app can identify your tune and song in seconds.

Shazam also allows you to watch music videos from YouTube and Apple Music.</p><p>The Pop-Up feature of Shazam is one of its best features. It enables you to identify music on any app like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. Besides, you can use the app offline and in the background to continue identifying songs even though the app is not in use.</p><p>The app will also notify you about your country’s and city’s current music scene, recommend playlists according to your tastes and lets you share songs on social media. The Shazam app has been downloaded over 200 million times in 150+ countries.

A three-minute song can temporarily take up to 20MB of storage space on your phone’s memory card, while longer songs may take even more, so it is important to make sure that you have enough free space on your phone before you start using this app.</p><h4 id="2-Reverse-Audio"><a href="#2-Reverse-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enhancing-Old-PCs-The-Persistent-Trend-of-Modifying-AGP-Slots-for-New-GPUs-Improved-Networking-Discover-the-Top-2-Adapters"><a href="#Enhancing-Old-PCs-The-Persistent-Trend-of-Modifying-AGP-Slots-for-New-GPUs-Improved-Networking-Discover-the-Top-2-Adapters" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing Old PCs: The Persistent Trend of Modifying AGP Slots for New GPUs &amp; Improved Networking - Discover the Top 2 Adapters"></a>Enhancing Old PCs: The Persistent Trend of Modifying AGP Slots for New GPUs &amp; Improved Networking - Discover the Top 2 Adapters</h2><p>Strangely enough, the past few months of 2024 have seen prominent discussions of a few modern-day AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) mods — the first is a mod of questionable practicality to get a GTX 960 working on an AGP board, which took considerable gymnastics. The second involves repurposing an AGP port on a Super Socket 7 motherboard for faster, more modern networking speeds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/tercio%5Fmiranda/status/1764956853069344810" >Tercio_miranda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> recently posted a mod from a retro PC gaming community on Facebook. The process (pictured below) involved using both an AGP-to-PCI and a PCI-to-PCIe adapter to install a GTX 960 onto an ancient motherboard.</p><p> The AGP interface is newer and, thus, likely faster than the PCI interface on the motherboard, so using the first adapter is highly questionable; however, the user probably didn’t have a PCI to PCIe adaptor handy. The GPU is ultimately listed in an included AIDA64 screenshot, showing that it is functional. The user didn’t share performance benchmarks, but this setup may be enough for Crysis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QYgYq7hUqARXB4fFQkNQ84-320-80.png"                      alt="Photograph of the AGP-to-PCI mod attached to the PCI-to-PCIe mod needed to install a GTX 960 in an old Athlon XP 2400+ PC."                ></p><p> Photograph of the AGP-to-PCI mod attached to the PCI-to-PCIe mod needed to install a GTX 960 in an old Athlon XP 2400+ PC.  (Image credit: Christian Rudewig on FB (via @tercio_miranda on Twitter))</p><p> For instance, back in August of 2009, Don Woligroski,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/agp-radeon-overclocking,2395-4.html" >writing for_Tom’s Hardware_ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , used an OC’d CPU and a powerful native AGP card<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/agp-radeon-overclocking,2395-4.html" >to get Crysis running at 65 FPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Low Physics on an AGP board originally released in November 2005. PCIe debuted in 2003, so this was well after many faster boards with newer standards were already on the market. This means that, yes, AGP could run Crysis while it was still common, and it remained one of the most demanding games on PC for several years after its 2007 release.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> People<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/yes-intels-feeble-arc-a380-gpu-can-run-crysis" >still test games with it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> these days, though<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hands-on-with-crysis-remastereds-new-ray-tracing-upgrade"><em>Crysis: Remastered</em> and its ray tracing</a> are definitely the more intensive choice for modern, non-AGP graphics cards.</p><p> YouTuber RECNAS also has a minute-long YouTube video that highlights his Super Socket 7 motherboard and, subsequently, an AGP-to-PCI networking adapter. Since RECNAS wanted to repurpose this roughly late 90s-era Super Socket 7 motherboard as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/nas" >NAS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , he didn’t want to be relegated to the slower, shared PCI bandwidth on the board.</p><p> This means that if he could get the NAS running through the fastest available port on the board, AGP, he could achieve the speed he’s looking for. We’ve embedded the original video of him achieving this below.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> After testing with the AGP-to-PCI adapter, he’s achieved just over 200 MB&#x2F;s throughput on his Super Socket 7 Board. The exact reading averages 198 Mebibytes per second, which converts to roughly 207 MB&#x2F;s. This is compared to the reported shared PCI bandwidth of 133 MB&#x2F;s, or more realistically, 92 MB&#x2F;s, according to RECNAS.</p><p> Now, the maximum rate of the original AGP port is 533 MB&#x2F;s, and AGP 3.5 eventually phased out at 2133 MB&#x2F;s— but as the name implies, these ports were targeted at graphics expansions, not storage. The later stage of AGP graphics support could get pretty interesting, though, especially if you were willing to<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/agp-radeon-overclocking,2395-2.html" >overclock your AGP-supported motherboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> As you can see, the modding community is still hard at work wringing more functionality out of old gear, either for entertainment or out of necessity.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-novices-companion-to-av1-technology/"><u>2024 Approved Novice’s Companion to AV1 Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/az-video-grabber-in-depth-app-analysis-and-diversions-for-2024/"><u>AZ Video Grabber In-Depth App Analysis & Diversions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/building-your-virtual-persona-with-minimal-hassle-for-2024/"><u>Building Your Virtual Persona with Minimal Hassle for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-poco-m6-pro-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Poco M6 Pro 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/navigating-through-music-production-software-landscape-can-magix-samplitude-be-considered-supreme-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Through Music Production Software Landscape Can MAGIX Samplitude Be Considered Supreme for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/the-art-of-sound-visualization-combining-waveform-graphics-and-animation-techniques-in-premiere-pro/"><u>The Art of Sound Visualization Combining Waveform Graphics & Animation Techniques in Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-a-step-by-step-guide-to-integrating-lame-mp3-encoder-with-audacity/"><u>Updated A Step-by-Step Guide to Integrating Lame MP3 Encoder with Audacity</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137228/26400" target="_top" id="2137228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137228/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Once run it, click the “Import” button to load both the video and audio files. You can also directly drag and drop the media files to the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg"                      alt="remove audio from mkv"                ></p><h4 id="2-Add-audio-to-MKV"><a href="#2-Add-audio-to-MKV" class="headerlink" title="2 Add audio to MKV"></a>2 Add audio to MKV</h4><p> Now what you have to do is to drop the video file to the Video track in the Timeline and audio to the Audio Track. Then you can make the audio file fit your video by trimming or double click the audio file to set fade in&#x2F;out effects, speed up or slow down it, adjust volume so that it doesn’t drown out the original audio of your video, etc. If you want to remove the original audio, just right click the video in Timeline and select “Audio Detach” and press “Delete” to remove audio from video.</p><p> Besides adding an audio file, you can also use Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) to record and add your own voiceover.

AMD, an established player, apparently considers Nvidia’s 72-core Arm-powered Grace Hopper Superchip a competitor, which is why it decided to publish a<a class="link"   href="https://community.amd.com/t5/epyc-processors/amd-epyc-processors-lead-vs-arm-options-on-performance-and/ba-p/696480" >blog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that compared the performance of its EPYC processor to Nvidia’s Grace platform in a series of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark" >benchmarks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , claiming up to a 2x performance advantage. AMD also points out x86’s compatibility advantages over chips based on the Arm architecture. While, of course, such a comparison has to be taken with a grain of salt, it gives us some idea about the performance of Nvidia’s Grace CPU.</p><p> Based on tests conducted by AMD, its EPYC 9754 (128-cores) and 9654 (96 cores) processors deliver over twice the performance of Nvidia’s Grace CPU Superchip (72 cores) in various workloads, including general-purpose computing, server-side Java, transactional databases, decision support systems, web servers, in-memory analytics, video encoding, and high-performance computing (HPC).</p><p> For instance, in the SPECpower_ssj2008 benchmark, single- and dual-socket AMD EPYC systems outperform Nvidia Grace systems by approximately 2.50x and 2.75x, respectively. A dual-socket AMD EPYC 9654 system outperforms a similar Nvidia system by about 2.27x on the same tests, highlighting their superior energy efficiency.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/769jAFkkEjwFVXCtuqbJCg-320-80.png"                      alt="AMD"                ></p><p>(Image credit: AMD)</p><p> AMD says its EPYC processors hold over 300 world records for performance and efficiency across various benchmarks, including business applications, technical computing, data management, data analytics, digital services, media and entertainment, and infrastructure solutions. Still, considering the fact that the main purpose of Nvidia’s Grace Hopper project is to run AI training and inference workloads, not exactly general-purpose server workloads, the results aren’t shocking. However, Nvidia’s Hopper is renowned for its prowess in AI applications.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMNBNWukZp6JztKfGogQGg-320-80.png"                      alt="AMD"                ></p><p>(Image credit: AMD)</p><p> AMD’s EPYC Zen 4 processors are built on the x86-64 architecture, ensuring compatibility with a wide array of software written for x86 architecture. By contrast, Nvidia’s Grace is based on the Arm architecture, and while Arm is catching up with x86 in terms of data center software support, x86 is still ahead in terms of compatibility.</p><p> AMD also notes that due to their high performance, energy efficiency, and compatibility with existing software and infrastructure, AMD’s EPYC processors offer a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than Nvidia’s Grace.</p><p> AMD’s own tests show that its EPYC processors outperform Nvidia’s Grace CPU Superchip across various key workloads, provide extensive compatibility due to their x86-64 architecture, and offer a proven, future-proof solution for diverse data center needs, which is why the company claims they are a better choice for general data center workloads. However, when it comes to AI training and inference, Nvidia’s Grace Hopper platform can offer significant advantages over AMD’s Instinct. After all, AI is what Nvidia’s Grace Hopper platform was developed to address from the start.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-privacy-first-securely-document-your-fb-video-conversations-for-2024/"><u>[New] Privacy First Securely Document Your FB Video Conversations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mmo-universe-guidebook-best-10-free-roleplaying-games/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, MMO Universe Guidebook Best 10 Free Roleplaying Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-top-30-metaverse-memes-crafting-hilarious-digital-delights/"><u>[Updated] Top 30 Metaverse Memes Crafting Hilarious Digital Delights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-atandt-wireless-worldwide-connectivity-rules/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to AT&T Wireless Worldwide Connectivity Rules</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-reasons-why-pokemon-gps-does-not-work-on-oppo-a56s-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Reasons why Pokémon GPS does not Work On Oppo A56s 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/new-premium-free-digital-audio-stitching-platforms-compared-for-2024/"><u>New Premium Free Digital Audio Stitching Platforms Compared for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-an-in-depth-analysis-of-waveedits-latest-features/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved An In-Depth Analysis of WaveEdits Latest Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-discovering-the-best-voice-altering-software-for-google-meet-as/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Discovering the Best Voice-Altering Software for Google Meet As</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123468/16836" target="_top" id="2123468">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123468" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123468/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

The company shared its live presentation via video sharing site<a class="link"   href="https://emakicms.com/brand/21/articles/view/2009106" >bilibili <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , where the presenter pulled out the actual device from his back pocket. The keyboard PC also has a built-in trackpad, so you don’t need to bring a mouse to use it. Interestingly, the portable mini PC lacks a built-in display, but the presenters had one interesting reason as to why it didn’t include one.</p><p> Before we dive into the details of the Linglong foldable keyboard PC, let’s first check out its key specifications:</p><p> Swipe to scroll horizontally</p><table><thead><tr><th>Processor</th><th>AMD Ryzen 7 8840U</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Memory</td><td>16GB &#x2F; 32GB</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>512GB &#x2F; 1TB M.2 NVMe 2230</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>1x USB 3.0 Type-A, 1x USB4 Type-C, 1x USB 3.2 Type-C</td></tr><tr><td>Communication</td><td>Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>60Wh (16,000mAh)</td></tr><tr><td>Charger</td><td>100W GaN</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>800g</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>15 x 10cm</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>CNY 2,999 (US$ 412) &#x2F; CNY 3,599 (US$ 495)</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Linglong presented its foldable PC as the ultimate mobile device of the future. Its tiny dimensions make it even smaller than other mini PCs, like<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-atomman-x7-ti-touchscreen-mini-pc-comes-packing-an-intel-core-ultra-9-185h" >the MinisForum AtomMax X7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . And instead of using a bulky display on its computer, the company suggested that users pair it with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/augmented-reality" >AR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or VR glasses. The company’s marketing material also showed the device being attached to a TV, tablet, or phone, allowing these devices to double as the screen for it, instead.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Linglong foldable keyboard PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Linglong on Bilibili)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Linglong foldable keyboard PC "                ></p><p> (Image credit: Linglong &#x2F; bilibili)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Linglong foldable keyboard PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Linglong on Bilibili)</p><p> The company boasts ten hours of battery life for light office work and up to six hours for watching movies. However, heavy workloads and gaming will cut down its useful life to just four hours or so. We should also consider that this doesn’t yet take into account the power use of a display.
