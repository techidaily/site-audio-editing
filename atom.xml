Even though the podcast is there for a decade, it is becoming highly famous now. It all started in 2005 when Apple announced broadcasting podcasts. There were radios before podcasting, and still, they are there!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-podcasting.jpg"                      alt="Video Podcasting"                ></p><p>We are now talking about <strong>video podcasts</strong> in the best possible manner. Is it worth creating video when it is primarily for audio format? Yes, it is not that easy as it seems to be! There are many versions to create video podcasts. Turning on a video while making a podcast is quite smart as now you have the required video content to post on YouTube. But that would be painful if you can’t hold the audience’s attention for more than five minutes. Visually compelling contents seem to be very important, especially when hosting your podcast on a central social platform such as YouTube.</p><p>Stay tuned as we are going to unleash the required elements to make the best video podcasts!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part1: What is a Video Podcast?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part2: Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part3: Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part4: How to create a Video Podcast?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-a-Video-Podcast"><a href="#What-is-a-Video-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="What is a Video Podcast?"></a>What is a Video Podcast?</h2><p>In simple words, a video podcast is generally a video format of audio podcasts. Overall, it is video content than mere audio content. Thus, they can’t listen to MP3 players. You must have a high-end digital media player, iTunes, and other video hosting platforms to listen to these kinds of podcasts. You can call it by a different name like vodcasting or videocasting as well. It is a version of podcasting despite other formats or versions of podcasts, including interview format, startup format, etc.</p><h2 id="Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference"><a href="#Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?"></a>Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>There is a visual difference between a vlog and a video podcast. Even though you can share both the content formats on a robust platform like YouTube, a video podcast is still different from a vlog in many terms.</p><p><strong>Type of Content</strong></p><p>The very first Difference is the type of content posted on both platforms. Vlogging is a kind of informal content presentation, whereas a vodcast is presented most formally in different versions.</p><p><strong>Style</strong></p><p>The vloggers generally show their lifestyles in various forms while also spreading social messages in some of their videos. A vlog may or may not be informative to the audience. On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.</p><p><strong>Type of Versions</strong></p><p>You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo&#x2F; Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews. It is generally informally represented to showcase reality to the audience.</p><h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting"></a>Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting</h2><p>There are many such merits and demerits of video podcasts if you decide to do it on a large scale. As mentioned earlier, it won’t be that easy if you are not consistent and committed. It will also help if you consider the following advantages and disadvantages of video podcasting as follows.</p><p>Pros of Video Podcasts</p><p><strong>Easy Accessibility</strong></p><p>An easy reach and wide accessibility is the first significant advantage of hosting a podcast. Every second person nowadays is fond of listening to podcasts, whether in audio or video formats. A podcast is a whole pack of informational content that doesn’t need further FAQs and similar issues to mention separately. On the other hand, accessibility is also comprehensive as everyone is utilizing the platform like YouTube.</p><p>A video podcast is the better alternative if you don’t have the required setup and budget to promote your business operations.</p><p><strong>Convenient</strong></p><p>Podcasts or Video Podcasts are more convenient options, especially on YouTube. Despite getting high value, a video podcast can listen everywhere when you have YouTube. Due to convenience, they are pretty similar to listening to an audio podcast, which is also free of cost except for your internet charges. A YouTube-hosted video podcast doesn’t need a paid subscription.</p><p><strong>Encourages productivity</strong></p><p>The very idea of presenting a podcast is to offer authentic information formally. It doesn’t matter what format you choose to host the best video podcast; it contains reliable information and the elements to encourage productivity in viewers’ minds.</p><p>Cons of Video Podcasts</p><p><strong>The challenging process of finding a relevant audience</strong></p><p>It may be super tough to find the relevant audience in the beginning. You may have to advertise on YouTube to see the audience. Else, a strategic marketing policy for your channel to ensure consistency and retention of followers or audience.</p><p><strong>Time Consuming</strong></p><p>Making a video podcast is generally a time-consuming procedure, specifically when you are new to the technical aspects. Well, a person who is passionate about podcasting can even hire a video editor to fulfill the editing and similar tasks. But that won’t be beneficial in the long run. It’s essential to learn video podcasting and further video editing to cut costs on a long-term basis.</p><p><strong>Distracting</strong></p><p>You should not create a podcast if it is distracting the audience within the first five minutes. That’s the primary concern as creating visually appealing video podcasts is more than challenging, especially for a beginner. Due to the podcasting hype, many creators develop video podcasts that are not even useful and highly distracting for the audience.</p><h2 id="How-to-create-a-Video-Podcast"><a href="#How-to-create-a-Video-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="How to create a Video Podcast?"></a>How to create a Video Podcast?</h2><p>Let’s review the step-by-step guide to create a video podcast, as mentioned below!</p><p>Step 1: Content Preparation</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/content-preparation-for-video-podcast.jpg"                      alt="Content Preparation For Video Podcast"                ></p><p>So yes, the content preparation is essential and foremost!

I have a video, but I want to mute it before sharing it with my friends from my iPhone!”</em></p><p>As a friend of mine asked me this, I realized that so many people find it hard to <strong>separate audio from a video</strong> in <strong>iMovie</strong> on iPhone or iPad. Since iMovie is available for Mac and iOS devices, it can ideally be used to edit your videos on the go. The best part is that it features various inbuilt features that you can use to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;Mac. In this post, I will let you know how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on different devices.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Remove-Audio-from-a-Video-in-iMovie-on-iPhone-iPad"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Remove-Audio-from-a-Video-in-iMovie-on-iPhone-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Part 1: How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>If you own an iPhone or an iPad, then you might be familiar with iMovie, which is an inbuilt video editor app, developed by Apple. If the app is not installed on your iOS device, then you can get it for free from the App Store. While there are several editing features in iMovie, it offers a dedicated option to control the audio level or remove it entirely from the video.</p><p>To learn how to remove sound from a video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad, you can follow these simple instructions:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Load the video to mute on your iMovie app</strong></p><p>At first, just get the iMovie app from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad and launch it. Once the iMovie app is launched, just tap on the “+” icon and choose to work on a new Movie project.</p><p>This will let you browse the available folders on your iPhone or iPad so that you can select the video to edit. Once you find the file, just select it, and load it on the iMovie interface by tapping on the “Create Movie” button.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>After when the video is loaded, you can check its icon on the timeline and view its preview at the top. Now, just tap on the video icon from the timeline to get various options at the bottom.</p><p>From all the available options at the bottom panel, just tap on the sound icon. You can now scroll the bar left or right to adjust the level of audio in the video. Besides that, you can also tap on the sound icon from the side to remove audio from the video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Save changes and export the edited video</strong></p><p>Once you have muted the sound in the video, just tap on the “Done” button to save the changes. After working on the project, you can tap on the share icon from the bottom and simply save the modified video on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone.</p><h3 id="Pro-Tip-How-to-Mute-Background-Noise-in-iMovie"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-to-Mute-Background-Noise-in-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How to Mute Background Noise in iMovie"></a>Pro Tip: How to Mute Background Noise in iMovie</h3><p>If you want, you can instantly use iMovie to remove audio from a part of the clip on your iOS device. To do this, just locate your video on the device and open it. Now, tap on the “Edit” button on the top to get different options. From here, you can tap on the sound icon from the top to mute the audio component in the video.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Audio-from-a-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Audio-from-a-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on Mac?"></a>Part 2. How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on Mac?</h2><p>Just like the iOS app, you can also learn how to remove audio from a video clip in iMovie on Mac as well. Although, the Mac app of iMovie also offers several other editing features that would come in handy to you. To learn how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on your Mac, you can follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the Video you want to edit on iMovie</strong></p><p>To begin with, just launch the iMovie application on your Mac and choose to work on a new project. Afterward, you can drag-and-drop the video to iMovie or click on the Import button to browse and load the file here.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Remove audio from the video in iMovie on Mac</strong></p><p>After the video has been added, you can view its thumbnail from the files section. At first, just drag the video and drop it to the timeline at the bottom so that you can make the needed edits.</p><p>Once the video is loaded, you can just right-click the video thumbnail from the timeline. Now, from the provided context menu, you can simply choose to detach audio from the file.</p><p>This will display the audio component of the file just below the video. To separate audio from the video in iMovie, you can right-click the audio component, and choose to delete it. You can further alter the audio component from here if you want to.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Save the Edited Video (with the Deleted Audio)</strong></p><p>That’s it! After making all the desired changes, you can go to the iMovie Menu &gt; File &gt; Share and simply choose to save the “File” of the project on your Mac.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

The camera microphones often record low-quality audio and they pick up background noises that can make the video unwatchable.</p><p> In case you were looking for a quick way to mute or remove the audio in your videos, you came to the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can mute audio in Windows Movie Maker or add new audio files to videos. We’re also going to provide you with an alternative solution that lets you have more control over the audio editing process.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Mute Audio in Windows Movie Maker?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Adding a New Audio Clip to a Video</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: A Better Way to Replace Original Audio on Windows</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Mute-Audio-in-Windows-Movie-Maker"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Mute-Audio-in-Windows-Movie-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Mute Audio in Windows Movie Maker?"></a>Part 1: How to Mute Audio in Windows Movie Maker?</h2><p> Muting the audio in a video clip is simple, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Windows Movie Maker lets you mute audio in just a few steps, so let’s see how you can mute videos with this video editor.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In order to start editing a video, you must first import it into Windows Movie Maker. Click on the <strong>Add Videos and Photos</strong> icon in the software’s <strong>Home tab</strong> and proceed to select the clip you’d like to mute.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing"                ></p><p> Click on the <strong>Open</strong> button in the Add Videos and Photos window and your clip will be imported into the software.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you added a clip to the storyboard you can preview it in order to decide which parts of the video you’d like to mute. Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> menu in the software’s ribbon, to gain access to the video editing tools Windows Movie Maker has to offer.</p><p> If you would like to mute only a portion of a video clip, you should position the playhead on the storyline at the exact location in the video where you want to make the cut and then click on the <strong>Split</strong> button.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make sure that the clip you want to mute is selected and click on the <strong>Video Volume icon</strong> on the left side of the Edit tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-windows-movie-maker.jpg"                      alt=" Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing"                ></p><p> Drag the slider all the way to the left to mute the audio. Click the <strong>Play button</strong> in the preview window to make sure that video’s sound is muted.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Adding-a-New-Audio-Clip-to-a-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Adding-a-New-Audio-Clip-to-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Adding a New Audio Clip to a Video"></a>Part 2: Adding a New Audio Clip to a Video</h2><p> Windows Movie Maker also lets you replace the existing audio clip with a new one. Once again, this process is easy and it can be completed in a few steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After you’ve muted the audio, click on the <strong>Add Music icon,</strong> that is located next to the Add Photos and Videos icon in the Home tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-windows-movie-maker.jpg"                      alt=" Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing"                ></p><p> A drop-down menu will appear offering you to select music from an online source or to import an audio file from your computer. Moreover, you can select the starting point of the song you’re importing so you don’t have to adjust the position of the audio file in your project manually.</p><p> In order to do this, you just have to position the playhead at the desired location and select the <strong>Add music at the current point</strong> option from the drop-down menu. You can change the position of the audio file by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard. Using MP3 or WMA audio file is recommended since other audio file formats may not be compatible with Windows Movie maker.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The audio file you imported will be automatically added to the video clip on the Storyboard. Click Play in the preview window to check if you like the result. Head over to the <strong>File</strong> menu and click on the <strong>Save Movie</strong> option. Windows Movie Maker will offer you a number of different options and if you’d like to save your video to the computer, you should select the <strong>For Computer</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-save.jpg"                      alt=" Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Wondershare-Filmora-A-Better-Way-to-Replace-Audio-Files-in-Videos-on-Windows-OS"><a href="#Part-3-Wondershare-Filmora-A-Better-Way-to-Replace-Audio-Files-in-Videos-on-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Wondershare Filmora - A Better Way to Replace Audio Files in Videos on Windows OS"></a>Part 3: Wondershare Filmora - A Better Way to Replace Audio Files in Videos on Windows OS</h2><p> Windows Movie Maker has been discontinued a while ago, and its video and audio editing tools only enable you to perform basic video editing tasks. We suggest using Wondershare Filmora if you would like to mute or replace audio files in your videos because it offers more powerful audio and video editing features. Here’s how you can mute or replace audio files in Wondershare Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the video clip into the software, by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> button and then selecting the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. If you want to replace the audio of the clip you can also select the new audio file from your hard drive and click on the <strong>Open</strong> button. Filmora offers a rich royalty free music library, you can use if you already don’t have the music you want to add to your video.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag and drop the video file to the timeline and then right-click on it. Select the <strong>Audio Detach</strong>  option from the context menu. The audio file will appear in the newly created audio track, and you can just click on the <strong>Volume</strong> icon located at the begging of the audio track to mute that audio track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-from-video.png"                      alt=" Audio Detach"                ></p><p> For more details, check our guide about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to remove audio from video in Filmora on Windows. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p> If you want to add a new audio clip to your project and replace the old one, you should select the existing audio file and press the delete button on your keyboard. You can then drag and drop the new audio file to the timeline from the software’s Media Bin, or the <strong>Music tab</strong>, in case you decide to use songs featured in Filmora’s music library. You can cut, trim or adjust the start and end position of the audio file or use some of the audio effects the software offers. When done, click on the <strong>Export</strong> button and select the output format that is most suitable for the project you’re working on.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Videos that have poor sound quality won’t impress anyone, but you shouldn’t worry because muting or replacing audio files is a task that requires almost no effort. Windows Movie Maker can be used to quickly mute an audio file, but if you want to have access to more professional audio editing tools using Wondershare Filmora is a much better option.
