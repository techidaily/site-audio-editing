Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.</p><p>Omegle’s website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators "></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></h2><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Chatroulette</strong></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png"                      alt="chatroulette-poster"                ></p><p>The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and&#x2F;or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat (“kills the conversation”).</p><p>A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents’ house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.</p><p>Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site’s terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There’s no doubt that it’s R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><pre><code>  * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.  * Millions of Users Across Different Countries  * Android and iOS apps are also available.  * Fewer Scammers and Bots.  * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.</code></pre><h4 id="2-ChatRandom"><a href="#2-ChatRandom" class="headerlink" title="2.

There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.</p><p>There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><pre><code>  * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.  * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.  * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.  * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.  * Members are matched by their unique code.  * On the site, you can video chat with others.  * You can easily use the site&#39;s features.</code></pre><h4 id="3-YouNow"><a href="#3-YouNow" class="headerlink" title="3. YouNow"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>YouNow</strong></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png"                      alt="younow-poster"                ></p><p>Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow’s goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.</p><p>Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn’t require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.</p><p>Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don’t match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.</p><p>The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there’s no way to guarantee you won’t be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><pre><code>  * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.  * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.  * Allows you to start a broadcast.  * You can join the broadcast of other streams also to interact with them.  * You can also make friends and send and receive gifts from them</code></pre><p>,.</p><h4 id="4-TinyChat"><a href="#4-TinyChat" class="headerlink" title="4.

With this chat site, you do not have to pay because you can invite people you know and set up topics for your chat. The platform offers the most extensive video and voice chat service online for five million minutes of airtime each day.</p><p>Numerous chat rooms are available, including those set up by residents of your area. TinyChat hosts live video streaming of TV shows that will let you watch them as they happen. If you can’t find a topic that interests you, create one. With TinyChat, you can connect with others through your webcam through audio, video, or text communication, just like with Omegle.</p><p>TinyChat is also a browser-based IM client and can be accessed from a PC, mobile device, or browser. While Omegle does not offer coins or points for unlocking special achievements or increasing your chances of landing in the live directory, it does provide you with a chance to interact with other users. A 500-coin token will also be awarded to you if you promote your room via TinyChat.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><pre><code>  * The process of starting a video call is very simple.  * There are no issues with the webcam.  * In your chat, you can control how many people participate.  * It&#39;s possible to block someone if you don&#39;t want to communicate with them.  * You can improve your experience with a variety of features.</code></pre><h4 id="5-FaceFlow"><a href="#5-FaceFlow" class="headerlink" title="5 .

In addition to offering free video chat and video conferencing with your friends, you can also communicate with strangers via FaceFlow. The new feature allows users to create a searchable profile and share their favorite online videos and pictures.</p><p>Aside from being simply another webcam chat service, this site is more like the amazing services offered by Skype. There is a one-to-one video chat feature as well as text chat. Furthermore, FaceFlow has released a multiplayer game called Flappy in which you have to team up against someone in order to complete the game.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><pre><code>  * Signing up takes no time at all;  * The service supports five languages;  * It has a modern interface;  * It offers a lot of free features;  * FaceFlow can connect with your friends and family while still using a dating website.</code></pre><h4 id="6-CamSurf"><a href="#6-CamSurf" class="headerlink" title="6.

If you’re trying to have fun, then you should visit this website. CamSurf has consistently delivered the most bizarre video chats we’ve ever experienced. The CamSurf website itself is straightforward and almost identical to the OmeTV website.</p><p>These two have a major difference in the types of people they attract. CamSurf has a vastly wider audience than OmeTV. While some individuals on OmeTV are looking for genuine conversation, on CamSurf, you’ll find people looking for genuine chat. It is our top choice for next time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><pre><code>  * Feature-rich website.  * A huge range of topics is available to discuss.  * You Mostly find genuine people here.</code></pre><h4 id="7-ChatRad"><a href="#7-ChatRad" class="headerlink" title="7.

People need to act the same in the real world, where they don’t run around naked or try to expose themselves all of the time… at least not in my world. Despite being a random video chat site, ChatRad is managed by a team of 24x7 moderators, so anything 18 and older can take advantage of the service in a safe environment regardless of their sexual orientation.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><pre><code>  * Very Strict Policies For Disrespectful People  * The chat is moderated 24/7 by an active team of moderators.  * It offers a very safe environment for people.</code></pre><h4 id="8-Bazoocam"><a href="#8-Bazoocam" class="headerlink" title="8.

Like most of the other websites mentioned, you’re paired up with an interloper haphazardly. Press “skip” and move on to the next person if you are unsatisfied with what you see.</p><p>As icebreakers or when you are bored of talking about yourself, you can join one of the multiplayer games on Boomcam. You are advised to do something unusual if you’re bored, but you are urged to wear your clothes. Put your best foot forward when playing golf in fancy dress or taking part in your favorite music. Try playing a string or wind instrument, and you’ll find many people to talk to.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><pre><code>  * The site offers a very high level of cleanliness.  * You can chat with the person of your choice.  * If you don&#39;t like a person you can skip to check the next candidate.  * It also offers a lot of multiplayer games to play with strangers.  * It will never let you get bored.</code></pre><h4 id="9-CamGo"><a href="#9-CamGo" class="headerlink" title="9.

Start a conversation with strangers, develop relationships without worrying about running into Covid, and explore webcam dating! Camgo’s Safe Search feature uses artificial intelligence to discover potential matchmaking partners. Your webcam chat loop will be kept out of the reach of people you don’t want to see! By chatting online with new people from your home, you can meet new people in a much easier and safe manner.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><pre><code>  * Easy To Meet New Strangers.  * The site is completely safe to use.  * It offers a great video chatting experience.</code></pre><h4 id="10-iMeetzu"><a href="#10-iMeetzu" class="headerlink" title="10. iMeetzu"></a><strong>10.</strong> <strong>iMeetzu</strong></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imeetzu-poster.png"                      alt="imeetzu-poster"                ></p><p>It is similar to Omegle in that there are random live video chats and text chat rooms available, but iMeetzu goes over and above that. Once you get past the randomness, you are given the option of joining a free online dating service or friend finder.</p><p>Over a thousand new members are joining every day on this one of the fastest-growing social networking sites.

Well, there are ample sources available over the internet where you can look up for royalty-free background music for videos.</p><p>And for this purpose, we have specifically tailored this post to help you find the best background music for video editing for free.</p><p>But before we get on to the sources, let’s first understand the significance of background music for videos and how to identify the right background music for videos. Moreover, we have also featured a popular and pro method with which you can add background music to videos without any hassle.</p><p><strong>You will Learn :</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">How Background Music Matters?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music</a></li><li><a href="#part3">How to Add Background Music to Video with Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#part4">List of Best Background Music for Videos: for Popular Needs</a></li><li><a href="#part5">List of Best Background Music for Videos: for Different Music Style</a></li><li><a href="#part6">List of Best Background Music for Videos For Festivals</a></li></ul><p>Let’s explore!</p><h2 id="How-Background-Music-Matters"><a href="#How-Background-Music-Matters" class="headerlink" title="How Background Music Matters?"></a>How Background Music Matters?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-studio.jpg"                      alt="music-studio"                ></p><p>Well, let’s suppose a hypothetical situation in this case. Imagine a world without sounds or music, and on the other hand, you live in a world that has music everywhere! Which one would you actually prefer to live in?</p><p>Likewise, foreground or background music for videos plays a vital role. It is a key ingredient to draw the attention of your viewers that may eventually convert into likes or subscribes or purchases. Incorporating background music in YouTube videos or private videos is an excellent way to create engaging and compelling content.</p><p>Here’s a quick fact for you!</p><p>Do you know? <em>“13 hours of video content is published every single minute over the renowned YouTube platform!”</em> And a huge chunk of these endearing videos generates a powerful impression on entertained viewers only because of the incorporated catchy background music.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways-to-Choose-the-Right-Background-Music"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-to-Choose-the-Right-Background-Music" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music"></a>Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music</h2><p>Now that you’ve understood that how best background music for videos matters, Step one’s complete. It’s time to move to Step two, i.e. opting for the most appropriate background music for your videos. It seems to be a simpler task but is actually a lot harder.</p><h3 id="How-to-opt-for-perfect-background-music-for-videos"><a href="#How-to-opt-for-perfect-background-music-for-videos" class="headerlink" title="How to opt for perfect background music for videos?"></a>How to opt for perfect background music for videos?</h3><p>Now the questions crop up, how you can choose the perfect background music for videos?</p><p>Let’s again take a hypothetical situation. You wish to paint a wall of your home to serve as an accent. Now, you simply don’t just rush to the Home Depot and start to browse every paint swatch available, right?</p><p>Since there are a million colors and shades available that will simply make you baffled. Eventually, it may take up forever to decide the final one. Instead, what you should actually do is narrow down your search by first deciding the color that you wish to get the accent wall painted with. After that, you then move on to opt for the appropriate shade.</p><p>Likewise, the same principle applies to filter out the background music for your videos. First, you need to understand the occasion that you’re making the video for. Then, you can actually focus on the most suitable beats for your video.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-occasion"><a href="#Understanding-the-occasion" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the occasion"></a>Understanding the occasion</h3><p>Now, let’s talk about ‘how would you understand what music is appropriate for the occasion?</p><p>Well, that entirely depends on the mood and occasion for which the video is being created.</p><p>Here we have listed some of the vital questions that you must ask yourself when it comes down to understanding the mood and occasion before you begin to opt for the best background music for your video.</p><ul><li>What is the theme&#x2F;occasion&#x2F;topic of your video?</li><li>What sort of emotions do you wish your viewers must feel while watching your video?</li><li>What is the preferred role of the music in your video? Do you want your music to be in the background or at the forefront?</li><li>Most of all, understand your audience. Do some research about what music type they most probably respond to?</li></ul><p>Since the answers can vary depending upon the occasion and the targeted audience.

Now, opt for the “Import Media Files…” option to import the video files from the hard disk storage of your computer to the User’s album. Once added, you can access all the imported video clips from the left media pane.</p><p>Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the required video files to the Filmora interface window from your PC.</p><p>Note: If you wish to add images to the User’s album, you can still get it done with the Import function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-import-tutorial-video.jpg"                      alt="1-import-tutorial-video"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Download-the-preferred-background-music-for-videos"><a href="#Step-3-Download-the-preferred-background-music-for-videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Download the preferred background music for videos"></a>Step 3: Download the preferred background music for videos</h3><p>Now that the videos have been imported, it’s now time to download and import the preferred background music for videos to the Filmora interface.</p><p>We have mentioned an entire list of both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos right below this section. You can either get the music from there or if you have already downloaded the music already, get it imported to the Filmora interface and proceed to the next step.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Apart from several features that Filmora offers, one notable benefit is that there is a huge collection of royalty-free audio libraries. This library includes background music and sound effects for different moods&#x2F;genres.</p><p>So, just in case you’re not a pro and can’t find and download music from websites.</p><p>Simply, get into the Audio Library of Filmora and then, opt for the desired music by tapping over the thumbnail in the media pane. To use the music, just drag and drop the required background music to the track in the timeline pane.</p><h3 id="Step-4-Add-video-to-the-timeline-track"><a href="#Step-4-Add-video-to-the-timeline-track" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Add video to the timeline track "></a>Step 4: Add video to the timeline track <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-music-onto-timeline.jpg"                      alt="drag-music-onto-timeline"                ></h3><p>Next, you need to drag the imported video available in the User’s Album to the Timeline track. Once you have the video placed in the timeline, proceed with dragging and dropping the required background music for your video to the track above the video track.</p><p>Note: If you’re adding multiple videos to the timeline track, ensure to arrange them according to the play order and without overlapping.</p><p>Just in case the length of the background music is greater than that of your video track, you can trim the music track down and adjust its position to match up with your video length. Also, you can do a real-time check while setting up the position in the previewing window to fine-tune your setting.</p><h3 id="Pro-Tip-for-Editing-Audio"><a href="#Pro-Tip-for-Editing-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip for Editing Audio"></a>Pro Tip for Editing Audio</h3><p>When it comes to editing audio&#x2F;background music, you simply need to double-tap over the music track in the timeline to crop up the audio editing panel. Here, you not just can edit your audio&#x2F;background music but also can add effects like fade in&#x2F;fade out, tune the pitch, adjust volume, set up Audio Equalizer, etc.</p><p>Moreover, with Filmora, you’re also enabled to change the audio speed separately in order to create slow-motion or a fast-forward effect. On top of that, you can even apply the reverse speed effect to playback the music track in reverse.</p><h3 id="Step-5-Export-your-video-with-a-music-file"><a href="#Step-5-Export-your-video-with-a-music-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Export your video with a music file "></a>Step 5: Export your video with a music file <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-music-with-video-step.jpg"                      alt="export-music-with-video-step"                ></h3><p>Once you have everything in place and are satisfied with your settings and the result, it’s time to process the video and export it over your computer storage.

For attaining a perfect balance between voiceovers and the background audio, the concept of “ducking” is implemented. I have come up with this post to help you know more about <strong>audio ducking</strong> and its importance. I will also include a detailed guide for <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >implementing audio ducking on a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a stepwise manner. Let’s begin!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-audio-ducking.jpg"                      alt="What is Audio Ducking"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Audio Ducking?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: When to Use Audio Ducking?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use the Audio Ducking Feature in Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Audio-Ducking-What-Is-It-All-About"><a href="#Audio-Ducking-What-Is-It-All-About" class="headerlink" title="Audio Ducking: What Is It All About?"></a>Audio Ducking: What Is It All About?</h2><p>In nutshell, it is a process that “ducks” or lowers the background volume when a voiceover appears. For instance, let’s consider that we already have a background score in our video playing. When we would add a narrator’s voice or apply a voiceover, it would create a lot of confusion. Therefore, we implement the audio ducking process to lower the background audio and amplify the voiceover instead.</p><p>In most cases, it is achieved through a side-chain compression technique. A control channel is set up that enables the compression of one sound (the background) while amplifying another (the voiceover).</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="When-Do-You-Need-to-Implement-Audio-Ducking"><a href="#When-Do-You-Need-to-Implement-Audio-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="When Do You Need to Implement Audio Ducking?"></a>When Do You Need to Implement Audio Ducking?</h2><p>Since the concept of audio ducking is pretty useful, it can be implemented in different ways during the video editing process. While you can apply the process to any video, here are some of the major instances where it is used.</p><h4 id="Travel-Vlogs"><a href="#Travel-Vlogs" class="headerlink" title="Travel Vlogs"></a>Travel Vlogs</h4><p>If you are a travel vlogger, you might already know how tough it can be to make yourself heard in a video. When there are too many background noises, your voice can be diminished. This is exactly where you can apply audio ducking to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >decrease the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and focus on your voice.</p><h4 id="Make-up-Tutorials"><a href="#Make-up-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="Make-up Tutorials"></a>Make-up Tutorials</h4><p>While creating make-up video tutorials, most of us use a background track to keep our viewers engaged. At the same time, you need to let them know about the process by speaking clearly. If you use audio ducking, then you can easily attain a perfect balance between both sounds.</p><h4 id="Other-Instances"><a href="#Other-Instances" class="headerlink" title="Other Instances"></a>Other Instances</h4><p>Ideally, if you are creating any other tutorial video for your audience, then audio ducking can be useful. From making video game tutorials to coming up with video lectures on a crucial topic, the concept would come in handy time and time again.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-Audio-Ducking-Feature-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Audio-Ducking-Feature-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Audio Ducking Feature in Filmora?"></a>How to Use the Audio Ducking Feature in Filmora?</h2><p>To implement audio ducking in your videos, you can use a reliable editing tool like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It has a dedicated audio mixer that would let you split, detach, split, or mute the audio.</li><li>The application can also be used to add voiceovers to your video on its native interface.

Import Your Videos on Filmora"></a>Step 1.  Import Your Videos on Filmora</h4><p>To begin with, you have to install Wondershare Filmora on your computer and launch it. Now, go to the “Import” feature from the top, choose to add files, and browse and load your videos. After adding the video, you can drag it to the timeline below to start editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-audio-files.jpg"                      alt="Import Files"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Import-An-Audio-or-Record-Voiceovers"><a href="#Step-2-Import-An-Audio-or-Record-Voiceovers" class="headerlink" title="Step 2.  Import An Audio or Record Voiceovers"></a>Step 2.  Import An Audio or Record Voiceovers</h4><p>Let’s suppose that your video already has an audio track in the background, and now you wish to add another audio component. Most of the people would like to record their voices in the video. For this, you can click on the voiceover (mic) icon at the bottom of the preview panel. This will open a dedicated window so that you can start recording your voice for the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-voiceovers-audio-ducking.jpg"                      alt="Record Voiceover for Audio Ducking"                ></p><p>Apart from that, you can also go to the “Import” feature to add any other audio component to the project. Besides that, Wondershare Filmora also has a wide range of royalty-free audio files that you can easily add to your projects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/royalty-free-audio-files.jpg"                      alt="Royalty-free Audio files for Audio Ducking"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Apply-Audio-Ducking-to-Your-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Apply-Audio-Ducking-to-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3.

To export the voice after converting it from text, you have to follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To export the converted voice from text, you have to write the content you want to convert and export as an audio file in ‘Text Edit’. Open Text Edit and write the content or paste it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri-voice-generators-mac3.jpg"                      alt="siri-voice-generators-mac3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have written everything in the Text Edit, select that text and right-click to see the options. From these options, go to the Services and then click on ‘Add to iTunes as a spoken Track’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri-voice-generators-mac4.jpg"                      alt="siri-voice-generators-mac4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on ‘Add to iTunes as a spoken Track’, a screen will pop up to select a system voice and place where you want the file to be saved. After selecting your preferred voice and location, click continue. The audio file has been successfully created and saved into your select destination.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri-voice-generators-mac5.jpg"                      alt="siri-voice-generators-mac5"                ></p><p>The generate voice file can be used for anything you want. It can be used for all your purposes. You can add it to your presentations, videos, tutorials, and more. All these voices that are generated using Siri will sound like a natural and Human-like voice to make videos more engaging and attractive to the viewers. It is not necessary to use Siri just to generate voices that can be used in videos. These voices can be used for multiple objectives. You can use Siri Voice Generator to covert the book into voices and then listen to them while you are walking, driving, or jogging to make the most of your time. It is the best tool that can help you achieve so many objectives very easily and conveniently.</p><hr><h2 id="For-Windows"><a href="#For-Windows" class="headerlink" title="For Windows"></a>For Windows</h2><p>Since Window doesn’t have any voice generator like Siri, it is not possible to get your text converted into the voice from your system’s built-in features. To convert the text into voice in Windows, it is necessary to use an external service provider. We know that Siri voice generator is the best text-to-voice converter to use while converting your text to audio. But unfortunately, Apple hasn’t introduced any website for their Siri Voice Generator. This makes it difficult for the users of the Windows operating system to convert their text into a voice using Siri. But there is no need to be worried, we are here to help you solve this problem. We have found some of the best text-to-voice converter websites that will provide you with the same experience of Siri and its features. There are multiple websites out there that claim to generate the best Siri voices. But it is difficult to choose the best one from all those platforms. We are going to provide you with the best alternative of Siri that can provide you with the same features and qualities as Siri. One of the best alternatives for Siri is Google text to Speech.</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech"><strong>Google Text-to-Speech</strong></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-speech-to-text-poster.png"                      alt="google-speech-to-text-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Chart Attached</p><p><strong>Language Coverage:</strong> 40+</p><p><strong>Voice Choices:</strong> 220+</p><p>There is no doubt in the fact that there is no platform or website that can take place of Siri. But Google’s Text-to-Speech service is something worth considering as an alternative to Siri. With its service, Google provides its users with a wide variety of language choices to choose from to fulfill the need of every user, no matter where the user lives. The best thing about Google Text-to-Speech is its extensive range of voice choices. You have more than 220 voices to choose from for your content. There is no need to make all your content sound similar. You can always change the voice of your content to match it with the content type and its audience. Google uses the latest technologies to provide you the customized voices for your brand to stand out from the crowd and make your videos and other content unique and different from others. Google incorporates DeepMind’s speech synthesis to provide you with the best and most accurate results. The voice generated by Google can’t be differentiated because it sounds like a natural and human-like voice. But the thing that makes it less attractive is its pricing. Unlike Siri for Mac, Google charges its user for using its Text-to-voice service on the basis of characters. But all the astounding features and natural voices of Google text-to-speech makes it worth every penny you spend on it. Google has two packages to be availed, Standard and WaveNet. The WaveNet package contains the voices that are used by Google in its products and service such as Google Search, Google Assistance, and Google Translate.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>PACKAGE</strong></th><th><strong>PRICE</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Standard Voices</strong></td><td>$4.00&#x2F;1 Million Characters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>WaveNet Voices</strong></td><td>$16.00&#x2F;1 Million Characters</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Just like Google Text-to-Speech, there various other amazing platforms that provide you with the same services like Siri.

More than just <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adding special effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, another thing that you might want to do is to mute video in specific parts, such as when there is crappy noise.</p><p>There are many instances wherein you will find it practical to mute some parts of the video you are editing. One of the reasons to mute it is when there is crappy noise in the background. The sound of a barking dog, loud footsteps, or rain, among others, can affect the quality of your video. Any distracting or broken sound in the background should be removed so as not to affect the overall quality of the footage negatively. For instance, if the video is an interview of someone and bad words or potentially offensive statements have been uttered, you might also find it practical to mute the video. If you plan to embed <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >background music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, muting the audio will also be beneficial.</p><h2 id="How-to-Mute-Audio-from-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Mute-Audio-from-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Mute Audio from Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>How to Mute Audio from Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Generally speaking, there are two ways by which the software can be used.</p><p><strong><em>To begin with, get a free trial copy of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</em></strong></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Methode 1</strong>: The first one is through using the <strong>“</strong> <strong>Mute”</strong> feature.

There are a lot of tools available – here are some of our favorites.</p><h2 id="8-Best-Audio-Spectrum-Templates"><a href="#8-Best-Audio-Spectrum-Templates" class="headerlink" title="8 Best Audio Spectrum Templates"></a>8 Best Audio Spectrum Templates</h2><h3 id="1-Audio-Spectrum-Music-Visualizer"><a href="#1-Audio-Spectrum-Music-Visualizer" class="headerlink" title="1. Audio Spectrum Music Visualizer"></a>1. Audio Spectrum Music Visualizer</h3><p>This audio-reactive visualizer is the ultimate option if you want to show off your music or share something that you enjoy. With a multiple number of customizable options, and various colors that you can use (6 dark and six bright), you will find that it’s straightforward to make it look exactly how you want it to look. On top of that, it includes a video tutorial that shows you how to make it work in After Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-spectrum-music-visualizer.jpg"                      alt="Audio Spectrum Music Visualizer"                ></p><h3 id="2-Free-After-Effects-Audio-Visualizer-Velosofy"><a href="#2-Free-After-Effects-Audio-Visualizer-Velosofy" class="headerlink" title="2.

With an attractive background and multiple speeds available, this is a straightforward way for you to add some visualization to your next music upload. Everything is customizable, so you can really take it and make it your own, too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/download-audio-spectrum-velosofy.jpg"                      alt="Free After Effects Audio Visualizer"                ></p><h3 id="3-Light-Audio-Spectrum"><a href="#3-Light-Audio-Spectrum" class="headerlink" title="3. Light Audio Spectrum"></a>3. Light Audio Spectrum</h3><p>This visualizer is found over at VideoBlocks, which is an easy to use website that allows you to get your hands on all sorts of templates for After Effects and other video editing software options. This particular one uses the time-honored visualization that’s similar to what you’d see on a soundboard, with continually rising and falling bars that bring you into the music. It also has some light visuals on the upper half of the animation, which can make it feel like you’re DJing!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/light-audio-spectrum.jpg"                      alt="Light Audio Spectrum"                ></p><h3 id="4-Animated-Audio-Spectrum"><a href="#4-Animated-Audio-Spectrum" class="headerlink" title="4. Animated Audio Spectrum"></a>4. Animated Audio Spectrum</h3><p>With 15 different options, this is a unique option that you can use to bring a little bit of visualization to your next YouTube video. It has ten radial spectrums, four horizontal spectrums, and the very unique animated avatar. The avatar is similar to the other audio spectrum visualizations, but it brings a more humanoid twist to it. This is available for use in After Effects and is at a standard 1920 x 1080 resolution and a visual speed of 60 Frames Per Second (FPS).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/animated-audio-spectrum.jpg"                      alt="Animated Audio Spectrum"                ></p><h3 id="5-Ultimate-Audio-Spectrum"><a href="#5-Ultimate-Audio-Spectrum" class="headerlink" title="5. Ultimate Audio Spectrum"></a>5. Ultimate Audio Spectrum</h3><p>The Ultimate Audio Spectrum has a variety of visual appearances and audio visualizations, which makes it easy for you to find the one that you like and what you want to be able to use. It’s perfect for beginners because it has been coded in such a way that, if there’s an error, it automatically corrects without the user even seeing it. Flashes, pumps, bass effects, sliders, and even a space to put song information makes it simple for you to get things set up and then use it for any music video project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/ultimate-audio-spectrum.jpg"                      alt="Ultimate Audio Spectrum"                ></p><h3 id="6-Round-Audio-Spectrum"><a href="#6-Round-Audio-Spectrum" class="headerlink" title="6. Round Audio Spectrum"></a>6. Round Audio Spectrum</h3><p>Round audio spectrums are popular because they offer a simple way to visualize the music without taking away from it. Like many of the options on the Pond5 website, this one is built for modern versions of After Effects. It’s available in Full HD, and you don’t need anything else to add it to any project. It’s a clean, classy way to add some visuals to your next music project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/round-audio-spectrum.jpg"                      alt="Round Audio Spectrum"                ></p><h3 id="7-Music-Note-for-Music-Party"><a href="#7-Music-Note-for-Music-Party" class="headerlink" title="7. Music Note for Music Party"></a>7. Music Note for Music Party</h3><p>Horizontal and Round options are pretty typical for audio visuals, but this music note takes it to a whole new level. While it still uses the technology you see in round options, it has two different ones connected by stems, which makes it look like a music note. The color is entirely uniform (other than the visualization areas on the circles), which gives it a clean, seamless look that you won’t find anywhere else. This is an excellent addition to any DJ’s repertoire or if you want to do something a little different with a music video for YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/music-note-for-music-party.jpg"                      alt="Music Note for Music Party"                ></p><h3 id="8-Free-Audio-Visualizer-AE-Templates"><a href="#8-Free-Audio-Visualizer-AE-Templates" class="headerlink" title="8. Free Audio Visualizer AE Templates"></a>8. Free Audio Visualizer AE Templates</h3><p>The last of our audio spectrum options uses a horizontal “wave” system that allows you to get a look at the music that you’re listening to. With multiple color options and an easy to customize the format, you’ll find it quite entrancing when you decide to use this for any of your projects. They even suggest you use it for podcasts and other speaking videos you may be uploading to YouTube because the colors help your audience to engage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/free-audio-visualizer-ae-templates.jpg"                      alt="Free Audio Visualizer AE Templates"                ></p><p>Whether you’re looking to download some audio spectrum files or you want a whole software option to download, video and audio spectrum tools are a lot of fun to play with. We hope that these options can help you to figure out what you need to do and which audio spectrum tools you want to use for your projects. It’s worth taking a look and seeing what you can find.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, let’s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.</p><h3 id="1-Add-Music-and-Sound-Effect-to-Videos-in-YouTube-Studio"><a href="#1-Add-Music-and-Sound-Effect-to-Videos-in-YouTube-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio"></a>1. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio</h3><p>A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after they’ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesn’t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.</p><p>There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the <strong>Creator Studio Classic</strong> tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="Add Music to YouTube Video"                ></p><p>Select Audio Option</p><p>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the <strong>Audio</strong> option. Start browsing through YouTube’s collection of royalty-free music and click on the <strong>ADD TO VIDEO</strong> button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.</p><p>You can check the detailed information about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to add music to YouTube video here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-audio-library-free-music-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Use Audio in YouTube Audio Library"                ></p><p>YouTube Audio Library Interface</p><p>Optionally you can also download music and audio effects from YouTube Studio’s Audio Library first, and then add the downloaded music to videos with the video editor you have installed on your computer.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Veed-io-to-Add-Music-to-Videos"><a href="#3-Use-Veed-io-to-Add-Music-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.

You should simply select if you want to upload a file from your computer, a camera, your Dropbox account or via a link and wait for your video to be uploaded.
