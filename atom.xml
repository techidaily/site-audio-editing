Listen to Yourself</strong></p><p>First of all, you have to think about what you have to work with. Record yourself talking with the app on your phone that records audio. If you do not listen carefully to your voice, you will not know what needs to be fixed.</p><p>Take a moment to listen to your voice. Because you’re now hearing your voice from an external perspective, it might sound completely different from how you thought it would. You can’t always avoid mistakes, but you can learn from them.</p><p>Take note of how you sound and accept that this is exactly how you sound. During this exercise, listen carefully as words come out of your mouth, study your pitch, and record your voice so you can review the recording later after you’ve completed your exercise.</p><p><strong>2. Relax Your Muscles</strong></p><p>As a consequence of stress, bad posture, and injuries, our muscles are drowning in tension. Our entire lives involve the use of our bodies, which directly affects our muscles and adds a great deal of tension. There are four key areas of our body. If you want to make your voice deeper, then you have to release tension from these four key areas. They include the tongue, jaw, throat, and neck. All these organs play a key role in controlling your voice. So, if you are able to relieve stress from these organs and you are able to relax them, then you can easily make your voice deeper with a little practice.</p><p><strong>3. Use Your Diaphram</strong></p><p>If you’re wondering how to make your voice deeper, you shouldn’t use your chest for breathing when we have a whole respiratory system to control. As a rule of thumb, the deeper your voice sounds, the deeper the air you inhale goes. You can direct the air to go just where you want it by adjusting the diaphragm.</p><p>As you breathe in, bring your nose to your mouth and push your chest backward while taking deep breaths from your nose. When you exhale, tell yourself your full name as you do so. When you speak, you may feel a vibration. It is now easier for you to produce a deeper voice effect since you have learned how to use your diaphragm.</p><p>In the world of professional singing, diaphragmatic breathing is one of the most popular techniques. With it, they can control their voice and position it precisely when they want, to produce deep, low-pitched cries (or even high-pitched cries). When you first start, you won’t be able to do it naturally, but you’ll be able to do it subconsciously with practice.</p><p><strong>4. Practice Your Chest Voice</strong></p><p>The magic happens in your chest voice. You can make it sound stronger, deeper, and less nasal with a little control. These exercises will focus on deepening your voice since you’re looking for ways to make your voice deeper.</p><p>Engage your throat first and then speak normally. You will sound lighter and less confident if you usually speak through your nose, which is not good for a deep voice.</p><p>Make a hissing sound while exhaling a deep diaphragmatic breath. Having your voice-controlled right within your lungs will allow you to open up your chest. It would help if you started talking now. You will feel your voice flowing up and out of your mouth via your breath. This is the voice of your chest.</p><p><strong>5. Hum Like You Mean It</strong></p><p>Humming warms up your voice, making it easier to control. In addition, it unleashes feelings of relaxation throughout your entire body, so your muscles can be relaxed. With Hum, you’ll be able to lower your voice pitch, talk deeper, and even make your voice sound deeper in a video. Hold your breath with a deep humming for as long as possible. During this process, your vocal cords will be stretched, and stretched vocal cords always give a voice a deeper tone.</p><p>As you breathe in again, point your chin downwards toward your chest. Put your chin up and start humming. Speak now. You will feel intense and deep in your voice.</p><p>These are some of the natural ways to make your voice deeper. But the thing is, all of them need a lot of practice, and according to experts, one can also damage his vocal cords when practicing all these techniques. But as we told you earlier, there is an easier way of making your voice deeper which is discussed below.</p><h2 id="How-To-Make-Your-Voice-Deeper-With-Filmora"><a href="#How-To-Make-Your-Voice-Deeper-With-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How To Make Your Voice Deeper With Filmora?"></a><strong>How To Make Your Voice Deeper With Filmora?</strong></h2><p>You can use Filmora to make your voice sound deeper in your already recorded videos.

Most movie makers do not know how to build the tension and drop it. The carefully planned dynamics are your way to great mystery output.</p><p>The dynamics of the intense music are used to lower the volume and then burst out the music and reveal the big secret. A perfect balance between tension and revulsion creates a more powerful storyline and impacts the audience.</p><p>The first factor, tension, is always built slowly and steadily. The suspense background music is deployed in such a situation. Revulsion, on the other hand, is the next moment. It is when the monster is out of the closet. It is the revelation of the big secret of the movie. If tension is the suspenseful music, the revulsion is where horror music comes over.</p><p>The right balance between the two soundtracks will mark the success of your upcoming thriller. If the tension lasts longer, the audience breaks it on their own. It often occurs through a joke or breaking silence. Similarly, if the revulsion cues in soon, there is not enough time to build the fear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/suspense-music-in-film-1.jpg"                      alt="suspense scene"                ></p><p>For instance, the Main Theme from “Gravity” establishes volume and tension until the movie’s climax is reached. Similarly, “Braveheart” uses extensive crescendos to create an intense thriller aura. Most directors always use dissonance to establish a hype. The film “Planet of the Apes” used a mix of soothing and disturbing tones to make the audience uncomfortable.</p><p>In such a situation, you can use metal scraping with creepy laughter. The process will be concluded with a hint of echo and reverb for a scary vibe. The sound design is yet another way to build fear. The video game known as “Fall Out” used echoing music to leave a creepy impression.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/suspense-music-in-film-2.jpg"                      alt="fall out game using suspense music"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Tips-to-Better-Use-Suspense-Music-to-Create-Suspenseful-Atmosphere-to-the-Film"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-to-Better-Use-Suspense-Music-to-Create-Suspenseful-Atmosphere-to-the-Film" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Tips to Better Use Suspense Music to Create Suspenseful Atmosphere to the Film"></a>Part 2: Tips to Better Use Suspense Music to Create Suspenseful Atmosphere to the Film</h2><p>Are you a filmmaker?

This suspense music continues to develop until the climax is reached. The intense music is gradually built until a startling scream is heard.</p><p>Similarly, the false crescendos come with a twist. Instead of hearing a startling scream or a murder, people hear an uncomfortable silence that reveals nothing. It messes up with the audience big time. Don’t you agree?</p><h3 id="Repetition"><a href="#Repetition" class="headerlink" title="Repetition"></a>Repetition</h3><p>Repetition is yet another technique to create a promising suspenseful aura. The same bundle of chords is repeated, establishing a rhythmic tension. A predictable pattern emphasizes the song and storyline. Additionally, the sudden chord change can be incorporated to release the hype or create a new phase.</p><h3 id="Dissonance"><a href="#Dissonance" class="headerlink" title="Dissonance"></a>Dissonance</h3><p>The sound of two or more inharmonious notes develops a dissonant effect.

Very few people think of audio editing when they talk about AE, even though this application offers a simple way to add Fade in and fade out effects to audio files used in soundtracks.</p><p>However, you will need to have at least basic video and sound editing skills to fade in and fade out audio files in AE since the app doesn’t offer a preset that you can drag and drop to the timeline. So, in this article, we will show how to create the Fade in and fade out effects in Adobe After Effects in just a few simple steps.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Audio Mixer Software to Trim Your Sound Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE"><a href="#Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE"></a>Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects"></a>Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects</h3><p>Once you’ve created a new project in AE and you’ve imported the audio files you’d like to include in the soundtrack of the video you’re making, you should place that audio file on the timeline. Click on the arrow located next to the audio file, then click on the Audio arrow that will be displayed under the file, and finally click on the Waveform arrow. This will enable you to see the waveform of the audio file you’d like to edit on the timeline and allow you to add Fade in and fade out effects with more precision. The file you added to your composition will be displayed as a layer in the Composition tab located in the lower-left region of the software’s interface.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fade-out-in-audio-after-effects-waveform.jpg" alt="fade out/in audio waveform after effects"></p><h3 id="Step-2-Add-a-keyframe-to-the-audio-file"><a href="#Step-2-Add-a-keyframe-to-the-audio-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file"></a>Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file</h3><p>The next thing you will have to do is place the playhead at the exact location where you want the Fade In effect to start. In most cases, Fade effects are added at the starting point of the audio file, so you should position the playhead at the beginning of the timeline or zero seconds. You will be able to see a stopwatch next to the Audio Levels option located in the Composition tab. Click on it to add the first keyframe and assign a negative value to the Audio Level setting. -100db or -50db values will make the audio file silent, and you can pick either based on how long you want the Fade in effect to last. If you don’t know how to use keyframes in After Effects, <a class="link"   href="https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/how-to-set-keyframes-after-effects" >this article will give you some info <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/add-keyframe-fade-in-out-audio.jpg" alt="Add keyframe to fade out/in audio"></p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >15 Free After Effects Templates to Power up Your Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Step-3-Complete-Fade-out-in-audio-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Step-3-Complete-Fade-out-in-audio-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Complete Fade out&#x2F;in audio in After Effects"></a>Step 3: Complete Fade out&#x2F;in audio in After Effects</h3><p>Move the playhead to the location where you want the effect to end and add another keyframe by clicking on the ‘Add or remove keyframe at current time’ icon. Set the Audio Level value to 0db, and that is it. You’ve created the Fade in effect. Keep in mind that you can use more than two keyframes to fade in audio, enabling you to increase the audio level gradually. The process of creating the Fade effect requires you to add a keyframe that has a 0db value a few seconds before the clip ends and then add another keyframe at the very end of the audio file that has -50 or -100db audio level value.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/complete-fade-iin-out-audio-after-effects.jpg" alt="Complete fade out/in audio in After Effects"></p><h2 id="Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects"><a href="#Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects"></a>Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects</h2><p>The process of creating a fade in or a fade out effect in AE is quite simple, but it is up to you to discover creative ways of using these effects.

Avoid Hard Cuts</h3><p>A high pitch sound at the very begging of a new sequence can ruin your soundtrack and ultimately the entire video, so in case you’ve cut an audio file at the location where the sound peaks, you can apply a fade in effect to make the transition between two audio files softer.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Cut Video in After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression-3"><a href="#2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Be Mindful of Audio Compression"></a>2. Be Mindful of Audio Compression</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://theproaudiofiles.com/compression-techniques/" >Audio compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a process that reduces loud sounds and amplifies quiet sounds, resulting from the audio file’s dynamic range being compressed. In most cases, you won’t notice the effects of audio compression, but if you compress an audio file too much, you might get some unwanted side effects if you add a fade out effect to that file. That’s why it is best to rely on the default audio compression features a video or audio editing app offers.</p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively-3"><a href="#3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively"></a>3. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively</h3><p>Besides opening and closing scenes, you can also use the Fade in and fade out effects to mix two different tracks while the shot is still in progress. Fade out one track, make it look like a scene is ending, and then introduce a new theme that changes the mood of that scene. The important thing is to avoid reducing the audio level all the way to -100db because you might end up creating silence in a scene that disrupts the flow of an entire video.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Fading in or fading out audio files in Adobe After Effects doesn’t require much effort, as you have to add a few keyframes to the file and adjust the Audio Level value. However, finding the best way to improve the quality of your soundtrack by applying these effects may take some practice. Do you often add Fade in and fade out audio effects in AE?

This will enable you to see the waveform of the audio file you’d like to edit on the timeline and allow you to add Fade in and fade out effects with more precision.

You will be able to see a stopwatch next to the Audio Levels option located in the Composition tab. Click on it to add the first keyframe and assign a negative value to the Audio Level setting. -100db or -50db values will make the audio file silent, and you can pick either based on how long you want the Fade in effect to last.

Avoid Hard Cuts</h3><p>A high pitch sound at the very begging of a new sequence can ruin your soundtrack and ultimately the entire video, so in case you’ve cut an audio file at the location where the sound peaks, you can apply a fade in effect to make the transition between two audio files softer.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Cut Video in After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression"><a href="#2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression" class="headerlink" title="2.

Be Mindful of Audio Compression</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://theproaudiofiles.com/compression-techniques/" >Audio compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a process that reduces loud sounds and amplifies quiet sounds, resulting from the audio file’s dynamic range being compressed. In most cases, you won’t notice the effects of audio compression, but if you compress an audio file too much, you might get some unwanted side effects if you add a fade out effect to that file. That’s why it is best to rely on the default audio compression features a video or audio editing app offers.</p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively"><a href="#3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively" class="headerlink" title="3.

Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively</h3><p>Besides opening and closing scenes, you can also use the Fade in and fade out effects to mix two different tracks while the shot is still in progress. Fade out one track, make it look like a scene is ending, and then introduce a new theme that changes the mood of that scene. The important thing is to avoid reducing the audio level all the way to -100db because you might end up creating silence in a scene that disrupts the flow of an entire video.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Fading in or fading out audio files in Adobe After Effects doesn’t require much effort, as you have to add a few keyframes to the file and adjust the Audio Level value.

The process of creating the Fade effect requires you to add a keyframe that has a 0db value a few seconds before the clip ends and then add another keyframe at the very end of the audio file that has -50 or -100db audio level value.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/complete-fade-iin-out-audio-after-effects.jpg" alt="Complete fade out/in audio in After Effects"></p><h2 id="Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-2"><a href="#Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects"></a>Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects</h2><p>The process of creating a fade in or a fade out effect in AE is quite simple, but it is up to you to discover creative ways of using these effects.

Very few people think of audio editing when they talk about AE, even though this application offers a simple way to add Fade in and fade out effects to audio files used in soundtracks.</p><p>However, you will need to have at least basic video and sound editing skills to fade in and fade out audio files in AE since the app doesn’t offer a preset that you can drag and drop to the timeline. So, in this article, we will show how to create the Fade in and fade out effects in Adobe After Effects in just a few simple steps.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Audio Mixer Software to Trim Your Sound Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE-3"><a href="#Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE-3" class="headerlink" title="Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE"></a>Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects"></a>Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects</h3><p>Once you’ve created a new project in AE and you’ve imported the audio files you’d like to include in the soundtrack of the video you’re making, you should place that audio file on the timeline. Click on the arrow located next to the audio file, then click on the Audio arrow that will be displayed under the file, and finally click on the Waveform arrow. This will enable you to see the waveform of the audio file you’d like to edit on the timeline and allow you to add Fade in and fade out effects with more precision.

You will be able to see a stopwatch next to the Audio Levels option located in the Composition tab. Click on it to add the first keyframe and assign a negative value to the Audio Level setting. -100db or -50db values will make the audio file silent, and you can pick either based on how long you want the Fade in effect to last.

Follow these tips below to get clean and supreme audio quality:</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Avoid Noisy Places</strong></p><p>The easiest method to avoid having noisy audio in the first place is to avoid having noisy elements and surroundings in the first place. Recording in a peaceful area is essential for this to be accomplished.</p><p>A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.</p><p>After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?</p><p>Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Record A Test</strong></p><p>After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.</p><p>Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording</strong></p><p>After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating&#x2F;cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.</p><p>Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.</p><p>Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online"></a>Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online</h2><p><strong>1.Can Background Noise Be Removed From Audio</strong></p><p>Yes, the background can be removed from audio easily nowadays, whether it’s after you’ve done recording or before recording audio; there are plenty of online software and applications, both available for your PC and smartphones.</p><p>These can help you get rid of the unwanted noise from your audio—some of the best online websites that can help you achieve that have been reviewed above. Choose the one that meets your needs!</p><p><strong>2. Is There Anything I Can Do To Prevent Noisy Audio Before I Record?</strong></p><p>Prior to recording, it is essential to reduce any acoustic noise sources if at all feasible. During recording, airflow may cause havoc on microphone preamplifiers, resulting in artifacts that may be difficult to remove.</p><p>Be careful to utilize adequate windscreens on your microphones, mainly when recording outside. Sound sources such as wind noise, for example, may frequently be discovered and appropriately eliminated by giving them a cursory listen via headphones.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Remove Background Noise Online</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tips For Removing Background Noise From Audio BEFORE You Record</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Audio-Noise-And-Why-Is-It-Harmful-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Audio-Noise-And-Why-Is-It-Harmful-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Audio Noise And Why Is It Harmful?"></a>Part 1: What Is Audio Noise And Why Is It Harmful?</h2><p>No definition exists for audio noise; however, it is often defined as background noises such as fans, people chatting, automobiles or trucks going by, buzzing from broken audio wiring, or other ambient sounds that should not be included in your film.

Follow these tips below to get clean and supreme audio quality:</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Avoid Noisy Places</strong></p><p>The easiest method to avoid having noisy audio in the first place is to avoid having noisy elements and surroundings in the first place. Recording in a peaceful area is essential for this to be accomplished.</p><p>A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.</p><p>After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?</p><p>Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Record A Test</strong></p><p>After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.</p><p>Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording</strong></p><p>After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating&#x2F;cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.</p><p>Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.</p><p>Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online-3"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online"></a>Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online</h2><p><strong>1.Can Background Noise Be Removed From Audio</strong></p><p>Yes, the background can be removed from audio easily nowadays, whether it’s after you’ve done recording or before recording audio; there are plenty of online software and applications, both available for your PC and smartphones.</p><p>These can help you get rid of the unwanted noise from your audio—some of the best online websites that can help you achieve that have been reviewed above. Choose the one that meets your needs!</p><p><strong>2. Is There Anything I Can Do To Prevent Noisy Audio Before I Record?</strong></p><p>Prior to recording, it is essential to reduce any acoustic noise sources if at all feasible. During recording, airflow may cause havoc on microphone preamplifiers, resulting in artifacts that may be difficult to remove.</p><p>Be careful to utilize adequate windscreens on your microphones, mainly when recording outside. Sound sources such as wind noise, for example, may frequently be discovered and appropriately eliminated by giving them a cursory listen via headphones.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Uncovering-Plugins-That-Create-Realistic-Flatulent-Effects-for-Games-and-Films"><a href="#Uncovering-Plugins-That-Create-Realistic-Flatulent-Effects-for-Games-and-Films" class="headerlink" title="Uncovering Plugins That Create Realistic Flatulent Effects for Games and Films"></a>Uncovering Plugins That Create Realistic Flatulent Effects for Games and Films</h2><h5 id="Versatile-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Versatile-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora"></a>Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora</h5><p>An easy yet powerful editor</p><p>Numerous effects to choose from</p><p>Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you take a closer look at the digital space, you will find many platforms offering a wide range of sound effects for free download.

Clearing the Media File Cache"></a>1. Clearing the Media File Cache</h3><p>If you tried to import a video file into a project and the app notified you that it cannot import the file because there is no audio stream, you should head over to the <strong>Edit menu</strong> and select the <strong>Preferences Tab.</strong> Once the Preferences window pops up on the screen, click on the <strong>Media tab</strong> and then proceed to delete all files that are stored in the <strong>Media Cache Database</strong> and <strong>Media Cache Files</strong> folders. Restart the application after you’ve cleaned both of these folders and try to import the video clips into the project once more. If the issue persists, there are a few more things you can do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Clearing-Media-File-Cache-no-sound.jpg"                      alt="clear Media File Cache"                ></p><h3 id="2-Renaming-the-Media-Cache-Folder"><a href="#2-Renaming-the-Media-Cache-Folder" class="headerlink" title="2. Renaming the Media Cache Folder"></a>2. Renaming the Media Cache Folder</h3><p>The default location of Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files folders is <strong>&#x2F;Users&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Adobe&#x2F;Common</strong> on Mac computers and <strong>\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Common</strong> on PC computers. So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to <strong>Media Cache Files_OLD</strong> and <strong>Media Cache_OLD</strong>. Start Adobe Premiere Pro and check if you can import your video files into the editor.</p><h3 id="3-Moving-Media-Files-to-a-Different-Folder"><a href="#3-Moving-Media-Files-to-a-Different-Folder" class="headerlink" title="3. Moving Media Files to a Different Folder"></a>3. Moving Media Files to a Different Folder</h3><p>If renaming the folders didn’t do the trick you can try moving them from their default location. You can move them wherever you want on your computer, but it is best if you pick a location that is easy to remember, just so you can access them quickly in case you need to delete files that are stored in them.</p><h3 id="4-Installing-the-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#4-Installing-the-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="4. Installing the QuickTime Player"></a>4. Installing the QuickTime Player</h3><p>Sometimes the simplest solution is also the most effective one. Check if QuickTime is installed on your computer because installing this player can solve the audio importing issues in Adobe Premiere Pro.

Restart the application after you’ve cleaned both of these folders and try to import the video clips into the project once more.

So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to <strong>Media Cache Files_OLD</strong> and <strong>Media Cache_OLD</strong>. Start Adobe Premiere Pro and check if you can import your video files into the editor.</p><h3 id="3-Moving-Media-Files-to-a-Different-Folder-1"><a href="#3-Moving-Media-Files-to-a-Different-Folder-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to <strong>Media Cache Files_OLD</strong> and <strong>Media Cache_OLD</strong>.

Once installed, launch the software. To create a new project, tap on the “New Project” button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-1.jpg"                      alt="make a new project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Import from File Tab</strong></p><p>Once a new window opens, three different methods can be used to import audio on Filmora. Tap on “File” to select the option of “Import Media Files” from “Import Media” in the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-2.jpg"                      alt="use file tab to import audio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Import from Import Button</strong></p><p>The second method calls up users to import audio through a button. The user needs to tap on the “Import Media Files Here” button to add audio in Filmora directly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on import button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Import by Drag and Drop</strong></p><p>Users can import audios on Filmora in another way.

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism"><a href="#1-Minimalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation"><a href="#7-Animation" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><h3 id="Last-Words"><a href="#Last-Words" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint.

From the Insert section, select the ‘Media’ option visible at the extreme right side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-2.jpg"                      alt="access media section from insert tab"                ></p><p>Step 3: The Media offers 3 further options. Among those options, you have to hit the ‘Audio’ option. This will open a drop-down from where you have to click on ‘Record Audio.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-3.jpg"                      alt="select record audio option"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now, a small window for Record Sound will show up. Here, set a name for your recording and hit the Record button to start the recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-4.jpg"                      alt="click on start recording button"                ></p><p>Step 5: Once you have completed the recording, click on the Stop button to end the recording and then hit the ‘Ok’ button to exit the recording window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-5.jpg"                      alt="stop recording process"                ></p><p>Step 6: At the end, a speaker icon will appear on the screen. When you hover on that icon, it will show the option to play the recording. You can adjust the speaker icon on the slide, and lastly, save your changes to PowerPoint.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-6.jpg"                      alt="speaker icon of recording"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-on-PowerPoint-in-Mac-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-on-PowerPoint-in-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record Audio on PowerPoint in Mac?"></a>Part 2: How to Record Audio on PowerPoint in Mac?</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, PowerPoint is available for both Windows and macOS, so how can we forget about Mac users? This section of the article will be talking about how to record audio on a PowerPoint Mac. If you are a Mac user and you plan to learn about this, then the following section is for you. By following the steps below, you can record audio on Powerpoint in Mac.</p><p>Step 1: Firstly, open PowerPoint and create a new presentation to record voice-over PowerPoint in Mac. You can also import any file from your Mac to PowerPoint for audio recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-7.jpg"                      alt="import ppt file"                ></p><p>Step 2: After that, you have to open the slide where you want to record the audio. Then from the menu bar at the top, navigate to the ‘Insert’ section. In the Insert section, there will be an ‘Audio’ tab. Tap on it and then select the ‘Record Audio’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-8.jpg"                      alt="click on record audio"                ></p><p>Step 3: At this point, a Record Audio panel will show up on the right side of the screen. From that panel, click on the ‘Record’ button to start the recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-9.jpg"                      alt="hit record button"                ></p><p>Step 4: After you have completed the recording, hit the ‘Stop’ button. Now, PowerPoint will ask you to either Insert or Discard the audio. Upon clicking on ‘Insert,’ a speaker icon will pop up on the screen. You can listen to your recording from that speaker icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/record-audio-on-powerpoint-10.jpg"                      alt="insert your recording"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-7-PowerPoint-Presentation-Tips-to-Make-Creative-Slideshows-3"><a href="#Part-3-7-PowerPoint-Presentation-Tips-to-Make-Creative-Slideshows-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 7 PowerPoint Presentation Tips to Make Creative Slideshows"></a>Part 3: 7 PowerPoint Presentation Tips to Make Creative Slideshows</h2><p>Now that all the Windows and Mac users are satisfied after learning about PowerPoint voice recording, it’s the perfect time to share some very useful tips. In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism-3"><a href="#1-Minimalism-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements-3"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings-3"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust-3"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation-3"><a href="#7-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><h3 id="Last-Words-3"><a href="#Last-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint. A complete step-by-step guideline has been shared for both Mac and Windows users on audio recording with PowerPoint. We also talked about 7 tips that will surely improve the quality of your slides.</p><p>By using the right and effective tool, you can still make creative slides without bothering to follow any tips. Such a tool is Filmora by Wondershare. This is an all-in-one video editing software. With Filmora, you can make the perfect video slideshow by adding multiple images.</p><p>You can collectively import images from your device to Filmora, or else you can also take things from its stock library.

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism"><a href="#1-Minimalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation"><a href="#7-Animation" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><h3 id="Last-Words"><a href="#Last-Words" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint.

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism-3"><a href="#1-Minimalism-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements-3"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings-3"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust-3"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation-3"><a href="#7-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><h3 id="Last-Words-3"><a href="#Last-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint.

This means you can begin correcting and polishing your transcriptions immediately, thus, cutting down on time spent on the task!</p><h2 id="7-Best-MP3-To-Text-Converter-for-Windows-Mac"><a href="#7-Best-MP3-To-Text-Converter-for-Windows-Mac" class="headerlink" title="7 Best MP3 To Text Converter for Windows&#x2F;Mac"></a>7 Best MP3 To Text Converter for Windows&#x2F;Mac</h2><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

Your audio file is stored on someone else’s server since you have to submit it to the service.</p><p>Your audio might be revealed to the public if that service is ever hacked or someone working there is not honest. In some circumstances, this may not be an issue, but in others, it might be a major one. In certain sectors, it might result in legal issues and large penalties. Many online voice to text services aren’t an option if you operate in a profession with tight privacy rules, such as healthcare.</p><h3 id="Audio-to-text-PC-software-is-Better-1"><a href="#Audio-to-text-PC-software-is-Better-1" class="headerlink" title="Audio-to-text PC software is Better"></a>Audio-to-text PC software is Better</h3><p>While there are certain drawbacks to computer-assisted transcribing, it is not without merit. It’s a cheap method to convert your audio, and it can “learn” from its errors and improve over time thanks to the newest machine learning technologies. Simple audio material, taking notes, and other tasks with a low degree of complexity are best handled by software or web-based solutions. Even so, you’ll have to proofread everything and make a significant number of mistakes.</p><p>It’s also beneficial in cases when accuracy is less crucial than having the material translated to text, such as contact center monitoring. If the material is only being read internally, perfection may be less essential than speed and cost.</p><h2 id="Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h2><p>Do you wish to convert an MP3 file to a text file and transcribe a speech? You may utilize the online auto transcribing tool provided by Filmora! It’s quick and simple to operate. Say goodbye to hours of manually transcribing audio transcriptions and welcome to automated transcriptions that just take a few clicks. There is no software to download; everything is done online.</p><p>Simply upload your audio recording, then choose the Auto Transcribe option. You may make minor changes to the transcription if necessary. WAV, M4A, and other common audio formats are all supported by Filmora’s speech-to-text service.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

Even Apple users can install Google Podcasts via the App Store. It’s free and lets you discover, stream, and download podcasts.</p><p>Google Podcast has already hit 100 million downloads, an indication of its rising popularity both among content creators and users. Users prefer it for its navigable, search-aligned, minimalist interface. And prominent podcast creators are focusing on the app to make their episodes accessible to millions of Android users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Google-Podcasts-Features"><a href="#Part-2-Google-Podcasts-Features" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Google Podcasts Features"></a>Part 2: Google Podcasts Features</h2><p>Compatible with Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Blackberry, and ChromeOS, Google Podcast is relatively a novice compared to dedicated podcast services. Still, Google Podcast seamlessly incorporates nearly every feature one needs to listen to podcasts.</p><p>Search and Personalized Recommendations</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-2.jpg"                      alt="google podcast search"                ></p><p>The most significant feature of Google Podcast is its algorithm-based recommendations that connect users with shows that suit their listening habits. As a new user, you might want to explore new topics and taste new concepts, and that’s where Google Podcast will impress you. But even more than that, it will automatically recommend suitable podcasts depending on your interest and previous engagements with the platform.</p><p>Google Podcast app covers a plethora of podcasts, so you do not have to switch to other platforms to discover something new or topics you love.</p><p>Free and Ad-free Experience</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-3.jpg"                      alt="google podcast ad free"                ></p><p>Google Podcast is completely free in a world where podcast platforms demand high charges for an ad-free and high-quality experience. All you need is a Google account to register and listen to anything available on the platform. In addition, podcast creators have to qualify to Google’s standards before submitting the podcast on the forum, ensuring you will listen to the podcast in high quality.</p><p>Clean UI</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-4.jpg"                      alt="google podcast interface"                ></p><p>Whether you’ve used a podcast platform before or not, the Google Podcast platform will seem familiar. Once you sign up, the interface will welcome you with podcasts covering all genres arranged neatly in a grid view for convenience.</p><p>In line with simplicity, the Settings option in the Google Platform app is as basic as basic gets. Plus, it allows you to conveniently organize your subscriptions and downloads via the Library tab.</p><p>One more thing: although Google Podcast is primarily designed for Android users, its counterparts on other OS, like Apple, Web, and macOS, remain simple and easy to use.</p><p>Auto-downloads, Sleep Timer, and Seamless Switch Between Devices</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-5.jpg"                      alt="google podcast downloads"                ></p><p>Google Podcast automatically downloads the podcasts you love and removes them after you’ve listened to the particular episodes.</p><p>Another significant characteristic of the Google Podcast platform is its intuitiveness. For instance, many podcast platforms do not automatically switch to the next episode, but you do not have to worry about such aspects with Google Podcast. You can also put a sleep timer.</p><p>Given that it’s available on all primary OS, you can seamlessly switch from one device to another.

For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer. The audio directly from the camera could be a little faint, resulting from the recording being farther from where you are. While the audio from the microphone would give you a high-quality audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-3.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file. Right-click on the audio file and click on detach audio to separate the audio file from the screen recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-4.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>Return the audio file and the screen recording to the normal position, which gives you three layers on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-5.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>Next, select your audio and your video by making sure both footages are related to each other and then right-click and then tap the audio synchronization. This will sync the audio and the video together, and the echo will seize because the footage will perfectly match the audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-6.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-–-Merging-Audio-and-Video-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-–-Merging-Audio-and-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video"></a>Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video</h2><p>The first way that can help you sync audio and video is merging the two files. You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.</p><ul><li>To proceed, press <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Command</strong>&gt; key on Windows and Mac respectively. Now, pick out the two files that you want to merge. You will now get the Merge Clips menu having a list of options. Choose Audio option and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro"                ></p><ul><li>Premiere Pro will now examine your video’s audio with the help of External audio and find out the similarities. In a couple of minutes, you will receive a new file with the name given to it in the Merge Clips menu.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-Manually-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-Manually-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro</h2><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Another is the manual way to sync audio to your videos. In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-file-sync-audio-manually.jpg"                      alt="import files"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, you may have either used a professional slate&#x2F;clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-manually.jpg"                      alt="merge audio manually"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly. Just in case, if a little tweaking is still required, click the audio file and hold down the Shift key while tapping left or right arrow key to adjust the audio file as per requirement.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/finish-sync-audio.jpg"                      alt="finish sync audio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-with-Plug-in-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-with-Plug-in-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Sync Audio to Video with Plug in"></a>Part 4: How to Sync Audio to Video with Plug in</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.redgiant.com/products/shooter-pluraleyes/" >PluralEyes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the next ideal option to work with. It is a plug-in and comes for $200 from Red Giant. When you have the projects like documentaries which include numerous camera angles, PluralEyes easily handles such stuff and make audio and video synchronization easy for you.</p><ul><li>For this, run PluralEyes and hit on <strong>Add Media</strong> to import the clip. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file directly to Premiere Pro. Now, click on <strong>Synchronize</strong> and let the program do the job.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sync-audio-PluralEyes.jpg"                      alt="PluralEyes sync audio"                ></p><ul><li>You will notice the synced clips in green while the files that are not synchronized will show up in red as errors. In case there are files with the red error, you need to get to the Sync drop-down menu and click <strong>Try Really Hard</strong>.</li><li>When the entire files are synced, hit on <strong>Export Timeline</strong> and you can then drag the exported project into Premiere Pro.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-How-to-Record-Audio-Properly-3"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-How-to-Record-Audio-Properly-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly"></a>Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly</h2><p>Nothing is worse than a bad quality audio file. You must have always wanted to keep a high-quality audio file, correct? More than desire, it is a vital thing to have. Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >quality microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and an <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/" >audio recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.</p><p>The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1&#x2F;8” jacks.</p><p>You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:</p><h3 id="1-Reasonably-Priced"><a href="#1-Reasonably-Priced" class="headerlink" title="1. Reasonably Priced"></a>1. Reasonably Priced</h3><p>By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.</p><h3 id="2-Easy-Accessibility"><a href="#2-Easy-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Easy Accessibility"></a>2. Easy Accessibility</h3><p>The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you’ve got a trackpad&#x2F;mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.</p><p><strong>You may also feel interested in:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 Best Software to Detach Audio from Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Remove Background Music from Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Remove Sound From Video on Desktop or Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><h5 id="Benjamin-Arango-1"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango-1" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>As a beginner, you must first fully understand what a digital audio workstation is doing if you are going to decide which DAW is the best for you.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DAW stands for Digital Audio Workstation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
