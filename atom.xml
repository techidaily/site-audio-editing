    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-Technology-Find-the-Best-Deals-on-Computers-at-Your-Site-Name-Savvy-Shopper’s-Paradise"><a href="#Mastering-Technology-Find-the-Best-Deals-on-Computers-at-Your-Site-Name-Savvy-Shopper’s-Paradise" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Technology: Find the Best Deals on Computers at [Your Site Name] - Savvy Shopper’s Paradise"></a>Mastering Technology: Find the Best Deals on Computers at [Your Site Name] - Savvy Shopper’s Paradise</h2><p>This year’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex" >Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> trade show was filled interesting AI focused PCs, but often, their most interesting features had little to do with AI. Such is the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar" >MSI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ‘s MEG Vision X AI Desktop, which we stumbled upon in the company’s sprawling booth.</p><p> Due out in Q4 for an undisclosed price, the MEG Vision X will have, according to MSI reps “the latest” Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU at the time, which implies that it will have an Arrow Lake processor and a 5080 or 5090 card (presuming Nvidia announces one this fall). With all that horsepower, you could use this system to play high-end games, train models or just process a little local AI generated art.</p><p> But what makes the MEG Vision X stand out is not its ability to run AI or gaming tasks – any PC with a decent video card or an NPU could do that. It’s the 1080 x 1920 touch screen that takes up the entire front surface of the chassis that led us to name this desktop one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/best-of-computex-2024" >best products of Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The chassis with built-in screen is so impressive to look at that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger signed his name and the word “awesome” on the top of the Meg Vision X when he visited MSI’s booth.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYkvUDqMNVz6ycnx4BZFYV-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X with Gelsinger Signature"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> By default, the touch display shows key PC stats such as your CPU temperature and clock speed. It also allows you to launch your favorite apps on your primary screen by tapping a shortcut icon. You can change performance modes here as well, opting for more speed or quieter fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SRaW8dq9GVUxC4BK2xbzh-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> The display is seen by Windows as a full-fledged second display in portrait mode. So you can play YouTube videos on it or run apps on it if you wish. MSI reps said a game streamer should keep their chat or OBS window on the front-panel screen while gaming on their primary monitor. They also said that the touch screen uses Intel integrated graphics while the main monitor or any secondary monitors you attach would use the Nvidia graphics card.</p><p> We got to spend a few minutes with the MSI MEG Vision X and its touch screen and we were impressed with how responsive it was. We put a YouTube vertical video onto the touch screen and then swiped down to switch to a different one. The screen supports ten-point touch so you can pinch-to-zoom or even finger paint on it.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Of course, MSI, like every other PC OEM, feels compelled to tout the computer’s AI features and how they integrate with the screen. The screen itself is called an AI HMI and some of the shortcuts on it launch built-in MSI AI apps such as AI Artist x MSI Chat, which is a chat bot &#x2F; image generator that runs locally. A built-in microphone and speaker will let you issue voice commands either to MSI’s app or to Copilot.</p><p> There’s also MSI AI Engine, which adjusts performance based on AI. Then there’s AI Frozr, which does the same thing for cooling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naxGXKocxiSqBdGWe9LHqR-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> But even if having a local image generator &#x2F; chatbot is really valuable to you, you don’t need a special PC or an on-case screen on the case to get those features. MSI may have its own branded apps, but it’s likely using the same chat and image generation that’s available elsewhere. Anyone who has a decent graphics card can download and install Stable Diffusion image generator or LLama for chat. If you have an RTX card, try<a class="link"   href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI" >ComfyUI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a very powerful frontend for Stable Diffusion.</p><p> What you can’t get elsewhere is a full HD screen that takes up the entire front surface of your chassis. We have seen some cases with screens on the front – the<a class="link"   href="https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/D41MESHSCREENBlack.html" >Jonsbo D41 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes to mind. But MSI’s display takes up the entire space and is meant to be an integral part of the user experience, not just a cute special effect.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-tiktok-the-ultimate-guide-to-joining-lives/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unlocking TikTok The Ultimate Guide to Joining Lives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-exclusive-insights-viewing-nba-games-remotely/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive Insights Viewing NBA Games Remotely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-streamline-your-vids-top-5-chrome-filters-for-fb/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Streamline Your Vids Top 5 Chrome Filters for FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-premier-handwear-for-immersive-vr-experiences/"><u>[Updated] Premier Handwear for Immersive VR Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/diagnose-and-repair-fallout-76-network-problems-on-pc/"><u>Diagnose and Repair Fallout 76 Network Problems on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/fixing-incompatibility-resolving-your-devices-driver-issue-with-windows-update/"><u>Fixing Incompatibility: Resolving Your Device's Driver Issue with Windows Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://app-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-get-your-phone-numbers-back-the-best-iphone-apps-reviewed/"><u>How to Get Your Phone Numbers Back: The Best iPhone Apps Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-spoofing-life360-how-to-do-it-on-oppo-f25-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Spoofing Life360 How to Do it on Oppo F25 Pro 5G?

Music &amp; sound processing may be used with it. The editing and recording features are also a lot of fun to play with. Let us now begin our investigation into how lame for audacity may be downloaded and installed. Check out the Audacity website for additional tutorials on how to use Audacity.</p><p>Two files are included with the lame for audacity download. An mp3 encoding program for CD playback, Lame.exe, is the other one. Lame-enc.dll is the second (ICL 11,1). The “.regedit” Windows database has a copy of this file.</p><p>MPEG 1, 2, &amp; 2.5 are now included in Lame’s most recent release. a free encoding engine with additional layers of VBR ABR &amp; CBR encodings If your computer has at least a Pentium 4 CPU, encoding will be much quicker. Noise interference may be minimized using the advanced audio settings.</p><h2 id="Download-Lame-for-Audacity"><a href="#Download-Lame-for-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Download Lame for Audacity"></a>Download Lame for Audacity</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/download-lame-for-audacity-poster.png"                      alt="download-lame-for-audacity-poster"                ></p><p>Chrome OS does not support the most recent version of Audacity. It is possible to use Audacity on a Chromebook, even though it is not officially supported, by using the Chrome version for Linux Ubuntu. We wanted to be as helpful as possible in helping you get the most out of Audacity.</p><h2 id="How-to-install"><a href="#How-to-install" class="headerlink" title="How to install?"></a>How to install?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-download-lame-for-audacity.png"                      alt="lame-for-audacity-windows"                ></p><p>Installing Lame for Audacity is a simple process with no extra tools required. Right-click and choose “Install,” then restart your computer. Continue to press the “Next” button until you’ve completed the task. A lame mp3 encoder may now be installed.

There is an option to modify the bit rate. Once you have finished adjusting the bit rate, you may return to the main Audacity page by clicking on the “OK” button.</li><li>Select “File” and then “Export to mp3” from the drop-down menu.</li><li>Save the file on your computer. You will be required to input the ID3 tags for the artist’s name and the title of the music into the Audacity program. By clicking “Ok,” the encoding procedure for the file into the mp3 format will begin.</li></ul><h2 id="Lame-for-Audacity-Windows"><a href="#Lame-for-Audacity-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Lame for Audacity Windows"></a>Lame for Audacity Windows</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/lame-for-audacity-windows.png"                      alt="lame-for-audacity-windows"                ></p><p>You may either download or develop a suitable version of the Lame mp3 encoder, after which you can install it.

One of the most common problems we face is that our volumes are not normalized, and we need to take some extra time in order to achieve the best result for our audiences. Even with little or no knowledge about this very specific topic, we need to inform ourselves and find the solutions, make our videos more watch-able and our audios more listen-able, so to say.</p><p>There are several ways the audio normalization is achieved. One type is called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; the second is loudness normalization, adjusting the recording based on perceived loudness. RMS (Root-Mean-Square) changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p><p>Mostly, there are two reasons why we should give audio normalization a try. You need to decide yourself, what is your reason and expected outcome when you use audio normalization. First is when your aim is to get the maximum volume, but the second boils down to matching different volumes with each other.</p><p>When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.</p><p>More concretely, in general, audio normalization is when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, “the norm” for the project. It means that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.</p><p>You can have the desired result using different kinds of software. Nowadays, a lot of programs offer you the tool which facilitates this process. So, one of them would be DaVinci Resolve, which we are going to discuss in this article.</p><p>What is DaVinci Resolve? The description goes: “DaVinci Resolve is the world’s only solution that combines editing, color correction, visual effects, motion graphics and audio post production all in one software tool!” so, let’s discover what this software can do to help us balance the audio!</p><p>So, how to balance your audio in DaVinci Resolve? We are going to discuss everything step by step – how to set your target loudness level, how to monitor the loudness, and how you can use the automation feature.</p><p>Well, of course, have the program installed and opened. Then, add your video with the audio you want to edit or the audio separately, if that’s what you are aiming to do.</p><p>The first step you need to make is to set your target loudness level – for this, find the little settings button on the right bottom of the program and click on it. Now, go down to the Fairlight menu and change the Target Loudness Level. If you are doing the audio normalization for the Youtube content, then it is recommended to set it to -14 LUFS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-1.jpg"                      alt="set target loudness"                ></p><p>Next, you are going to head to the Fairlight page and make sure that your meters are open. the loudness meter is on the right top of the layout of the program, and it goes from +9 to -15 LUFS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-2.jpg"                      alt="make sure open the meters"                ></p><p>Here, zero represents exactly what our target loudness level is, in this case, as you remember, we set it to -14 LUFS. So, ensure that our loudness is as close as zero as possible on the meter, but you can also make it lower, such as -3. Whenever you play, you will be able to see that there are some numbers popping up to the right of the meter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-3.jpg"                      alt="set loudness as close as zero"                ></p><p>The first one, you’ll find, is Short – constantly changing, indicating how far above or below the target loudness level you are at a given time. Short Max tells you how far above or below your target loudness level the loudest point of your video is. Range is a measure of your quietest pick to your loudest peak, and the last one is Integrated – it gives you the overall loudness of your video in relation to your target loudness level. Integrated is the number we aim to keep around -3 or 0.</p><p>We can use our main slider (next to the sequence on the right) to make our video louder or quieter until we hit that target loudness level.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-4.jpg"                      alt="makee video louder or quieter"                ></p><p>Also, there is an automation tool that can help you dial in your loudness. In order to access this feature, find a red icon, looking like a wave with kind of a key frames.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-5.jpg"                      alt="automation tool help dial in loudness"                ></p><p>Next, open up your Index (on the far top panel, a little bit from the left), and make sure you are in the tracks menu in your editing index.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-6.jpg"                      alt="open index"                ></p><p>What you want to do is to make your main track visible on the timeline, so hit on the eyeball next to your main and go to your timeline, where you will expand your main track until you see your Loudness History options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-7.jpg"                      alt="make sure main track visible"                ></p><p>Here, you will need to check in the box next to Integrated and turn on the Loudness History. This will show the integrated loudness level, adjust your main track’s volume accordingly, so you are below the zero line.

It allows you to adjust the audio tempo to sync with the video. You can slow down or speed up the audio with the button and setting. Auto Audio Sync is the ability to sync video and audio together automatically. Moreover, it is an all-in-one video editor with powerful functionality and a fully stacked feature set.

For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer. The audio directly from the camera could be a little faint, resulting from the recording being farther from where you are. While the audio from the microphone would give you a high-quality audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-3.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file. Right-click on the audio file and click on detach audio to separate the audio file from the screen recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-4.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>Return the audio file and the screen recording to the normal position, which gives you three layers on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-5.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>Next, select your audio and your video by making sure both footages are related to each other and then right-click and then tap the audio synchronization. This will sync the audio and the video together, and the echo will seize because the footage will perfectly match the audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-6.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-–-Merging-Audio-and-Video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-–-Merging-Audio-and-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video"></a>Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video</h2><p>The first way that can help you sync audio and video is merging the two files. You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.</p><ul><li>To proceed, press <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Command</strong>&gt; key on Windows and Mac respectively. Now, pick out the two files that you want to merge. You will now get the Merge Clips menu having a list of options.

In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-file-sync-audio-manually.jpg"                      alt="import files"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136613/26400" target="_top" id="2136613">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136613" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136613/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, you may have either used a professional slate&#x2F;clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-manually.jpg"                      alt="merge audio manually"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly.

On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1&#x2F;8” jacks.</p><p>You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-your-key-to-effortless-igtv-media-downloads/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Your Key to Effortless IGTV Media Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-snap-a-story-with-an-insightful-audio-clip/"><u>[Updated] Snap a Story with an Insightful Audio Clip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-cast-poco-m6-pro-5g-to-computer-for-iphone-and-android-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Cast Poco M6 Pro 5G to Computer for iPhone and Android?

While you might know about the Audio Clip Mixer, which lets you take on the audio between clips, the Audio Track Mixer allows you to control a whole track, which can be beneficial in its own way. Sometimes you need to make big sweeping changes that affect everything, and no one wants to change their all sounds clip by clip, which is where the track mixer comes in handy.</p><p>So how do you use the audio track mixer to manage your audio inside of a video?

For instance, when you watch a TV show and have music cut over two characters talking, that’s an example of mixed tracks. You can mix music, dialogue, sound effects, voiceovers, and other things to create a seamless finished product. You can even have different types of audio, or have different tracks play in different earphones of the headset if you want to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-track-mixer-overview.jpg"                      alt="Audio Track Mixer overview"                ></p><p>With audio track mixer, you can see each track being played in real time, not just on the timeline but also on its own screen.

You’ll have total control over the sound, and the playback.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Audio-Track-Mixer-Settings"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Audio-Track-Mixer-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Audio Track Mixer Settings"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Audio Track Mixer Settings</h2><p>If you are the type of person that likes to work with the sound as it happens, then you can.

Such is the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar" >MSI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ‘s MEG Vision X AI Desktop, which we stumbled upon in the company’s sprawling booth.</p><p> Due out in Q4 for an undisclosed price, the MEG Vision X will have, according to MSI reps “the latest” Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU at the time, which implies that it will have an Arrow Lake processor and a 5080 or 5090 card (presuming Nvidia announces one this fall). With all that horsepower, you could use this system to play high-end games, train models or just process a little local AI generated art.</p><p> But what makes the MEG Vision X stand out is not its ability to run AI or gaming tasks – any PC with a decent video card or an NPU could do that. It’s the 1080 x 1920 touch screen that takes up the entire front surface of the chassis that led us to name this desktop one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/best-of-computex-2024" >best products of Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The chassis with built-in screen is so impressive to look at that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger signed his name and the word “awesome” on the top of the Meg Vision X when he visited MSI’s booth.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYkvUDqMNVz6ycnx4BZFYV-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X with Gelsinger Signature"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> By default, the touch display shows key PC stats such as your CPU temperature and clock speed. It also allows you to launch your favorite apps on your primary screen by tapping a shortcut icon. You can change performance modes here as well, opting for more speed or quieter fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SRaW8dq9GVUxC4BK2xbzh-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> The display is seen by Windows as a full-fledged second display in portrait mode. So you can play YouTube videos on it or run apps on it if you wish. MSI reps said a game streamer should keep their chat or OBS window on the front-panel screen while gaming on their primary monitor. They also said that the touch screen uses Intel integrated graphics while the main monitor or any secondary monitors you attach would use the Nvidia graphics card.</p><p> We got to spend a few minutes with the MSI MEG Vision X and its touch screen and we were impressed with how responsive it was. We put a YouTube vertical video onto the touch screen and then swiped down to switch to a different one. The screen supports ten-point touch so you can pinch-to-zoom or even finger paint on it.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Of course, MSI, like every other PC OEM, feels compelled to tout the computer’s AI features and how they integrate with the screen. The screen itself is called an AI HMI and some of the shortcuts on it launch built-in MSI AI apps such as AI Artist x MSI Chat, which is a chat bot &#x2F; image generator that runs locally. A built-in microphone and speaker will let you issue voice commands either to MSI’s app or to Copilot.</p><p> There’s also MSI AI Engine, which adjusts performance based on AI. Then there’s AI Frozr, which does the same thing for cooling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naxGXKocxiSqBdGWe9LHqR-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> But even if having a local image generator &#x2F; chatbot is really valuable to you, you don’t need a special PC or an on-case screen on the case to get those features. MSI may have its own branded apps, but it’s likely using the same chat and image generation that’s available elsewhere. Anyone who has a decent graphics card can download and install Stable Diffusion image generator or LLama for chat.

The second involves repurposing an AGP port on a Super Socket 7 motherboard for faster, more modern networking speeds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/tercio%5Fmiranda/status/1764956853069344810" >Tercio_miranda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> recently posted a mod from a retro PC gaming community on Facebook. The process (pictured below) involved using both an AGP-to-PCI and a PCI-to-PCIe adapter to install a GTX 960 onto an ancient motherboard.</p><p> The AGP interface is newer and, thus, likely faster than the PCI interface on the motherboard, so using the first adapter is highly questionable; however, the user probably didn’t have a PCI to PCIe adaptor handy. The GPU is ultimately listed in an included AIDA64 screenshot, showing that it is functional. The user didn’t share performance benchmarks, but this setup may be enough for Crysis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QYgYq7hUqARXB4fFQkNQ84-320-80.png"                      alt="Photograph of the AGP-to-PCI mod attached to the PCI-to-PCIe mod needed to install a GTX 960 in an old Athlon XP 2400+ PC."                ></p><p> Photograph of the AGP-to-PCI mod attached to the PCI-to-PCIe mod needed to install a GTX 960 in an old Athlon XP 2400+ PC.

PCIe debuted in 2003, so this was well after many faster boards with newer standards were already on the market. This means that, yes, AGP could run Crysis while it was still common, and it remained one of the most demanding games on PC for several years after its 2007 release.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> People<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/yes-intels-feeble-arc-a380-gpu-can-run-crysis" >still test games with it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> these days, though<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hands-on-with-crysis-remastereds-new-ray-tracing-upgrade"><em>Crysis: Remastered</em> and its ray tracing</a> are definitely the more intensive choice for modern, non-AGP graphics cards.</p><p> YouTuber RECNAS also has a minute-long YouTube video that highlights his Super Socket 7 motherboard and, subsequently, an AGP-to-PCI networking adapter. Since RECNAS wanted to repurpose this roughly late 90s-era Super Socket 7 motherboard as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/nas" >NAS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , he didn’t want to be relegated to the slower, shared PCI bandwidth on the board.</p><p> This means that if he could get the NAS running through the fastest available port on the board, AGP, he could achieve the speed he’s looking for. We’ve embedded the original video of him achieving this below.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> After testing with the AGP-to-PCI adapter, he’s achieved just over 200 MB&#x2F;s throughput on his Super Socket 7 Board.

Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:</p><h3 id="1-Reasonably-Priced"><a href="#1-Reasonably-Priced" class="headerlink" title="1. Reasonably Priced"></a>1. Reasonably Priced</h3><p>By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.</p><h3 id="2-Easy-Accessibility"><a href="#2-Easy-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Easy Accessibility"></a>2. Easy Accessibility</h3><p>The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you’ve got a trackpad&#x2F;mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.</p><p><strong>You may also feel interested in:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 Best Software to Detach Audio from Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Remove Background Music from Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Remove Sound From Video on Desktop or Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-messengervideo-snapper-directaccess/"><u>[New] In 2024, MessengerVideo Snapper – DirectAccess</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-perfecting-instagram-posts-tips-for-vertical-editing-in-final-cut-pro-x-for-2024/"><u>[New] Perfecting Instagram Posts Tips for Vertical Editing in Final Cut Pro X for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-directors-academy-youtube-channels-for-cinematic-innovation/"><u>2024 Approved Directors Academy YouTube Channels for Cinematic Innovation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-framing-perfection-a-filmmakers-guide-to-cinematic-youtube-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Framing Perfection A Filmmaker's Guide to Cinematic YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-simplifying-fast-forward-on-snapchat-a-first-timers-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Simplifying Fast-Forward on Snapchat A First Timer's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-7-ways-to-unlock-a-locked-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 7 Ways to Unlock a Locked ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-extract-silence-eradicating-audio-in-various-video-formats-mp4-mkv-avi-mov-wmv-2023-edition/"><u>In 2024, Extract Silence Eradicating Audio in Various Video Formats (MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WMV) -

It’s cooled by a 35-watt fan with an aluminum heatsink with four copper heat pipes.

This mixing software allows you easily record music or podcast for various platforms. In addition, it offers a sharing feature that will enable you to share directly from the platform. Adobe Audition provides two mixing modes: the waveform view and the multitrack view. While the Waveform view is ideal for stereo editing, the multitrack view allows users to edit tracks on a timeline. Luckily Audition enables you to switch between both views whenever you want, so you don’t have to choose one.</p><p>One of the impressive features that make Adobe Audition one of the best audio video mixers in 2022 is the ability to remove silence from inactive parts in the audio file. While doing this, you don’t have to lose sync in the file. As a result, it is ideal for podcasts and interview audios. It also features a loudness radar that allows you to analyze submix, single tracks, full mix, and many more according to several broadcast requirements.</p><p>Another nice feature we found impressive with Audition is the DeReverb tool that allows you to eliminate or remove reverberations from the audio file. IT efficiently handles short delays and spacious reverbs in your video and audio files. The sound remover tool is another impressive tool that allows you to remove car alarms, errant bumps, paper shuffling, and other unnecessary sounds from your audio and video file. You also gain access to the music remix tool that allows you to cut new versions of songs without necessarily sending them to the remixer.</p><p>You can efficiently adjust the song’s target duration to help you get the perfect fit. You can also customize the splices or favor rhythm elements to ensure the beats remain locked when necessary.

They need to satisfy their audience by giving them their most perfect production numbers. Nevertheless, there are instances when they need the aid of a device to conceal their mistakes or avoid making them. So they lip-sync and autotune their prerecorded songs.</p><p>Singers and music producers are not the only ones to use autotune. The most common users are ordinary people who have made music creation a part of their lives. Then how does autotuning operate?</p><p>The pitch is raised to the nearest correct tone when a person sings with the key off (out-of-tune). Moreover, the distortion can mask the out-of-tune parts (especially the highest and lowest pitches) in the overall performance.</p><h2 id="How-To-Add-Autotune-To-Audacity-Using-GSnap"><a href="#How-To-Add-Autotune-To-Audacity-Using-GSnap" class="headerlink" title="How To Add Autotune To Audacity Using GSnap?"></a><strong>How To Add Autotune To Audacity Using GSnap?</strong></h2><p>The autotune effect in audacity is enabled by the GSnap plugin (from GVST).

Many celebrities and influencers are already on it, and you might have heard them talking about their clubhouse conversations in their Instagram stories. In short, you may have heard a lot about this app, and you might be wondering why it is getting so popular. This is because this social media application has developed its reputation in part on exclusivity.</p><p>Although celebrities are joining this app, China has blocked it, and investors think this app has billion-dollar potential. The app is now viral these days, and according to some analytics, it got almost 2 Million installs in the first week of February. The app has taken over social media by storm. It is developed by <strong>Paul Davison</strong>, who was an entrepreneur at silicon valley, and <strong>Rohan Seth</strong>, who is an ex-Google employee. The main theme of this application revolves around the audio-chat.</p><p>Although it was released in 2020, it recently got a lot of attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his entry on this application. His conversation with the chief of Robinhood Markets, Vladimir Tenev, went viral on this platform, and we saw a sudden spike in the downloads of this application. If you are a regular fork who wants to know what’s going down on this exclusive social media platform and what it actually is, then we are here to guide you. Here is what you need to know about Clubhouse.</p><h2 id="What-is-Clubhouse"><a href="#What-is-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="What is Clubhouse?"></a><strong>What is <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clubhouse-drop-in-audio-chat/id1503133294" >Clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></h2><p>In simple words, Clubhouse is a voice-based social media app where people can interact with each other and do discussions on various topics in chatrooms. It is a new type of social product that allows its users to talk to anyone, tell stories, discuss ideas, and make friends worldwide. You can think of it just like a zoom phone call where all cameras are turned off, and sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of who is talking.</p><p>There are a variety of rooms in this app it means that you can jump into the chat rooms of different formats. To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening. It is something similar to a live and free-flowing podcast. You can choose to share your thoughts, or you can listen quietly to others.</p><p>Different clubhouse niches like song-writers, Entrepreneurs, Counselors, etc., could be an enjoyable way to spend your time. Listening to other people and talking about your problems freely makes you feel really good. It can open many networking opportunities for you, and with a private room option, you can organize an audio-party with your pals. One thing that must be kept in mind is that the conversation does not go outside the application as there is no recording option available, and discussions are not saved.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145079/17095" target="_top" id="2145079">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145079" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145079/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2><p>![ clubhouse-interface1](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> interface2.png)</p><p>The Clubhouse is only available on iOS devices right now. You cannot access it via Android or the web. It is also an invite-only app right now. It means that you need to know an existing clubhouse user if you want to join it. The current clubhouse users need to give access to their entire contact list to the application if they want to invite some of their friends.</p><p>If you are already a Twitter or Facebook user, then you should know that clubhouse rooms aren’t entirely free for all. There are some moderators who can freely speak, and they can also allow participants from the audience to speak freely. There is a subtle grey halo around the picture of participants that indicates who is speaking.</p><p>Anyone can create a room and set it to open. If a room is open, then it means that anyone can pop in. You can also create a social room which means that only your followers can join the room. In the end, there is a closed room option which for the invited guests only. The app also has clubs that can have members and can create re-occurring rooms.</p><p>You can follow clubs and people to know when they are participating in rooms and moderating. If you click on the calendar icon, you will get an unfiltered list of rooms happening at that time. This app has a simple interface, and it is easy to use. Once you create an account on this app, then you cannot delete your account, and you have to email the support team to request account deletion.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049390/7443" target="_top" id="2049390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Who-Uses-Clubhouse"><a href="#Who-Uses-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Clubhouse?"></a><strong>Who Uses Clubhouse?</strong></h2><p>The Clubhouse is getting popular among a lot of big celebrities. If you explore the app, then you may find people like Oprah, Kevin Hart, Drake, Chris Rock, or Ashton Kutcher talking in different rooms. They might be hosting different chats. This is basically the most appealing thing about the Clubhouse. You may get a chance to engage and chat with a lot of famous and popular people. It is one of the best apps out there for networking purposes. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerburg also made their appearances on this app, after which people saw a tremendous increase in its downloads.</p><p>Other than celebrities, the exclusivity of Clubhouse makes you feel secure and comfortable. There is a lot to learn, and you can do something productive on your time. There are a lot of experts out there that are teaching people about various things, such as MC Hammer hosts rooms related to cryptocurrencies. There are plenty of other experts from various fields. You can interact with them and ask for answers and solutions to your questions and problems. Most people and celebrities use Clubhouse fearlessly because they know that whatever they say on this application is not going to be a news headline the very next day.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983473">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983473">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983473%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983473/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Join-Clubhouse"><a href="#How-To-Join-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="How To Join Clubhouse?"></a><strong>How To Join Clubhouse?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse-invite.png"                      alt=" clubhouse-invite"                ></p><p>If the details mentioned above raised your interest in this application, then you should know that it is not for everyone. If you want to join this app, you have to be invited by someone already a user. If you get an invite from a registered user, you can then extend the invite to four other friends. If you do not get an invite and download the app directly from the Apple app store, they will put you on a waiting list. The Clubhouse CEO has promised that the app is going to open for everyone, eventually even for android users. But, right now, they want to grow their number of users slowly to make arrangements for the bigger number of users and overcome the difficulties that the existing users are facing.</p><p>If you want to download this application, then simply go to the apple app store and search for Clubhouse: Drop-in audio chat application. Download and install this application. After that, it will ask you to register. If an already registered user invites you, then you will be able to use this application with its full functionality; otherwise, you can reserve a username, and they will put you on their sweet waiting list.</p><h4 id="Bonus-want-to-record-clubhouse’s-audio-and-edit-it-in-your-own-way-Why-not-give-it-a-go-of-totally-free-Filmora-X"><a href="#Bonus-want-to-record-clubhouse’s-audio-and-edit-it-in-your-own-way-Why-not-give-it-a-go-of-totally-free-Filmora-X" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: want to record clubhouse’s audio and edit it in your own way?
