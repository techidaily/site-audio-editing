The maximum size of the video file you can upload to Online Audio Converter is <strong>2048mb</strong>, which means that you can even convert high-resolution files that last more than just a few minutes. Once you’ve uploaded a video file from your computer, <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or some other online destination, you just have to select the <strong>output format</strong> and <strong>the quality</strong> of the audio file. Optionally, you can click on <strong>the Advanced settings option</strong> if you would like to add <strong>fade in and fade out effects</strong>, try to <strong>remove voice</strong> or change the <strong>bitrates and sample rates</strong>.

You can use the audio as an instrumental or in other creative ways. Audacity is among the most popular vocal removers on the internet. It offers several ways to remove vocals clearly from your audio tracks or music files. Vocal isolation audacity is easy and takes only a few steps. However, we recommend the AI vocal remover feature by Filmora because it is more versatile and accurate.

So, first of all, the volume normalization is pretty much explained as follows: The process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. If it is a little bit difficult to understand, we have to highlight that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.</p><p>But, why bother at all and why not leave it the way it is? Well, the answer to this is almost the same as on why editing exists in general, right? Things are not perfect! This is the fact that prompts us to make our video clips and audio better, improve it at least on the level which can get us the right amount of viewers and listeners. Everyone have had some pain listening to several podcasts, when the volume was too high or too low, or there were so much background noise that the whole recording was hurting the ears of a person! People will not convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners if their user experience is not favored. So, it is in our best interest to serve their best interest, with a little bit of editing.</p><p>When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.</p><p>In the first case, you might have somewhat quite voice recording, and would like to make it better without changing its dynamic range, while making it as loud as possible. And when it comes to matching volumes, it is logical that you need to manipulate your editing this way in case you have a group of audio files, each or some of them are at different volumes, so, understandably, if not necessarily, you would like to make them come closer to the same volume.</p><p>So, until we give you the step-by step guide on how to normalize your volume in VLC player, we also need to inform you about audio normalization types. Here, generally, we come across three of them: a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. Last but not least, RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p><p>Using any of this, making it better to listen to your voice, without people being annoyed and their ears becoming exhausting with what you have to offer, you will be making it enjoyable for them and easy to come back to your content, as they will not be obliged to change the volume on their own audio players. Instead, their experience with you will be calm and effortless, which you are aiming to achieve.</p><p>So, not, what about VLC? – this is a very popular media player, favorite for a lot of people all around the world, so you should already be quite familiar with what it is, at least by having streamed videos and movies there. Speaking more of what it represents, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and additionally, the program can stream from popular websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.</p><p>As if it was not enough, you can do simple video and audio editing in VLC Media Player, which a lot of people are unaware of! For example, you can easily trim and cut videos. So, as it happens, we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. Sooo… How to do that? Because, actually, it is so simple that you might be surprised you didn’t know about this earlier. To learn how to normalize volume in VLC, follow this simple guideline:</p><p>First, of course, as every time working with any software, you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, you will need to check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, you can Save.</p><p>This is not something perfect, because it’s so simple to do and actually what it does is just help adjust the general volume, so it leaves the specifics alone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-1.jpg"                      alt="help adjust general volume"                ></p><p>But, it might be the case that you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC. So, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu there. And the steps are as follows:</p><p>First, on your VLC player, find Tools and then, in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and there you need to select All in Show settings – actually it is a little bit hard to find because this is in the bottom left corner of the window. From there, you will need to navigate to Audio, and then, a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. The checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor will probably be unchecked – so, check in it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-2.jpg"                      alt="find tools and go to preferences"                ></p><p>Next, see where Compressor is in the left panel?

The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p><p>Don’t underestimate Attack time and release time, either. They graduate the changes to ramp them up at first, then down again, rather than initiating them immediately. So, if you set them to your liking as well, this will ensure that you have a more fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, sometimes scary volume changes.</p><p>Therefore, you are now equipped with the most information you will need to normalize volume in VLC Player – so free to give it a go, play around with the different settings and carry out the best result imaginable for you!</p><h2 id="How-to-normalize-audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-normalize-audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to normalize audio in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>How to normalize audio in Wondershare Filmora?</h2><p>Now, even though we already know how to normalize audio in VLC in the simplest, as well as in the more advanced way, it might be even better if we know some more about normalizing audios in different programs.

Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App"></a><strong>1. Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App</strong></h3><p>Using an online web app is one of the easiest ways to extract drums from your song tracks. This is a great approach for beginners or people who do not have production experience. Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files. It usually plays the following functions:</p><ul><li>Loading and editing audio</li><li>Recording new tracks</li><li>Mixing and applying effects</li><li>Mastering</li><li>Exporting finished mixes</li></ul><p>After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take <a class="link"   href="https://moises.ai/" >Moises.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG"                      alt="moises.ai"                ></p><p>This makes it a great choice when removing drums from music on SoundCloud or the latest video of YouTube.

The following primary considerations can make a big difference in terms of noise:</p><h3 id="1-Pick-the-Right-Location"><a href="#1-Pick-the-Right-Location" class="headerlink" title="1. Pick the Right Location"></a>1. Pick the Right Location</h3><p>If you are recording an audio or video, the first step is to choose the right surroundings. Although no location can be completely noise-free, one can try. Places with less population and more nature are noise-free as usual. Book a studio for video or audio recording, as you don’t need much effort. They offer pre-arranged setups and space, which also includes noise-canceling equipment.</p><h3 id="2-Microphone-Quality-and-Position"><a href="#2-Microphone-Quality-and-Position" class="headerlink" title="2.

If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem?

So, first of all, the volume normalization is pretty much explained as follows: The process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. If it is a little bit difficult to understand, we have to highlight that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.</p><p>But, why bother at all and why not leave it the way it is? Well, the answer to this is almost the same as on why editing exists in general, right? Things are not perfect! This is the fact that prompts us to make our video clips and audio better, improve it at least on the level which can get us the right amount of viewers and listeners. Everyone have had some pain listening to several podcasts, when the volume was too high or too low, or there were so much background noise that the whole recording was hurting the ears of a person! People will not convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners if their user experience is not favored. So, it is in our best interest to serve their best interest, with a little bit of editing.</p><p>When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.</p><p>In the first case, you might have somewhat quite voice recording, and would like to make it better without changing its dynamic range, while making it as loud as possible. And when it comes to matching volumes, it is logical that you need to manipulate your editing this way in case you have a group of audio files, each or some of them are at different volumes, so, understandably, if not necessarily, you would like to make them come closer to the same volume.</p><p>So, until we give you the step-by step guide on how to normalize your volume in VLC player, we also need to inform you about audio normalization types. Here, generally, we come across three of them: a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. Last but not least, RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p><p>Using any of this, making it better to listen to your voice, without people being annoyed and their ears becoming exhausting with what you have to offer, you will be making it enjoyable for them and easy to come back to your content, as they will not be obliged to change the volume on their own audio players. Instead, their experience with you will be calm and effortless, which you are aiming to achieve.</p><p>So, not, what about VLC? – this is a very popular media player, favorite for a lot of people all around the world, so you should already be quite familiar with what it is, at least by having streamed videos and movies there. Speaking more of what it represents, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and additionally, the program can stream from popular websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.</p><p>As if it was not enough, you can do simple video and audio editing in VLC Media Player, which a lot of people are unaware of! For example, you can easily trim and cut videos. So, as it happens, we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. Sooo… How to do that? Because, actually, it is so simple that you might be surprised you didn’t know about this earlier. To learn how to normalize volume in VLC, follow this simple guideline:</p><p>First, of course, as every time working with any software, you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, you will need to check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, you can Save.</p><p>This is not something perfect, because it’s so simple to do and actually what it does is just help adjust the general volume, so it leaves the specifics alone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-1.jpg"                      alt="help adjust general volume"                ></p><p>But, it might be the case that you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC. So, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu there. And the steps are as follows:</p><p>First, on your VLC player, find Tools and then, in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and there you need to select All in Show settings – actually it is a little bit hard to find because this is in the bottom left corner of the window. From there, you will need to navigate to Audio, and then, a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. The checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor will probably be unchecked – so, check in it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-2.jpg"                      alt="find tools and go to preferences"                ></p><p>Next, see where Compressor is in the left panel? Select it. And now, you are free to make the changes to the levels as you see fit.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-3.jpg"                      alt="see compressor"                ></p><p>Here, if you are a little bit overwhelmed with the wide range of options to work on, you can just concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p><p>Don’t underestimate Attack time and release time, either. They graduate the changes to ramp them up at first, then down again, rather than initiating them immediately. So, if you set them to your liking as well, this will ensure that you have a more fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, sometimes scary volume changes.</p><p>Therefore, you are now equipped with the most information you will need to normalize volume in VLC Player – so free to give it a go, play around with the different settings and carry out the best result imaginable for you!</p><h2 id="How-to-normalize-audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-normalize-audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to normalize audio in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>How to normalize audio in Wondershare Filmora?</h2><p>Now, even though we already know how to normalize audio in VLC in the simplest, as well as in the more advanced way, it might be even better if we know some more about normalizing audios in different programs.

A podcast creation is the journey of many stages, including selecting the topic, name, podcast cover art, equipment, intro&#x2F;outro audio, recording&#x2F;editing equipment, and the promotion strategy. Thus, you must select the type of content beforehand to start recording the podcast effortlessly.</p><p>On the other hand, don’t get too complicated, especially when you are a beginner. This post is going to be an ultimate guide on how to record a podcast effortlessly.

And that is going to include content selection to choosing the right recording equipment.</p><p><strong>Plan the content</strong></p><p>The very first step is to plan the content of the podcast. Also, make sure that the topic or niche you will select must be up to your knowledge. It should be a topic for which you can discuss 100+ episodes. Invest the right amount of time in planning the content of the podcast.</p><p><strong>Choose co-host (optional)</strong></p><p>You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.</p><p><strong>Select the format, style, and length of the podcast</strong></p><p>After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.</p><p><strong>Consider Podcast Recording Equipment</strong></p><p>Don’t think of investing in a fancy podcast recording studio, especially when you are starting. Professionals even say that the outdoors is useful when you are confident to speak in public. It will also offer a preview of the background hustle, which further looks attractive and engaging to the listener.</p><p>You can even start from a phone with a good microphone setup. It’s better to invest in a good-quality microphone and have your little format ready all by itself. Try looking for an audio mixer if you have gone a bit advanced in podcast recording.</p><p><strong>Recording Software</strong></p><p>The last decision before recording is the selection of recording software. As a beginner, we’d like to recommend Audacity, a free tool when working on audio podcasts. Or, you must check out Wondershare Filmora X to beautify your video podcasts.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-a-Podcast-on-PC"><a href="#How-to-Record-a-Podcast-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="How to Record a Podcast on PC?"></a>How to Record a Podcast on PC?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora X is the best option if you want to know how to record a PC podcast.

And that is going to include content selection to choosing the right recording equipment.</p><p><strong>Plan the content</strong></p><p>The very first step is to plan the content of the podcast. Also, make sure that the topic or niche you will select must be up to your knowledge. It should be a topic for which you can discuss 100+ episodes. Invest the right amount of time in planning the content of the podcast.</p><p><strong>Choose co-host (optional)</strong></p><p>You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.</p><p><strong>Select the format, style, and length of the podcast</strong></p><p>After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.</p><p><strong>Consider Podcast Recording Equipment</strong></p><p>Don’t think of investing in a fancy podcast recording studio, especially when you are starting. Professionals even say that the outdoors is useful when you are confident to speak in public. It will also offer a preview of the background hustle, which further looks attractive and engaging to the listener.</p><p>You can even start from a phone with a good microphone setup. It’s better to invest in a good-quality microphone and have your little format ready all by itself. Try looking for an audio mixer if you have gone a bit advanced in podcast recording.</p><p><strong>Recording Software</strong></p><p>The last decision before recording is the selection of recording software.

Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App</strong></h3><p>Using an online web app is one of the easiest ways to extract drums from your song tracks. This is a great approach for beginners or people who do not have production experience. Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files. It usually plays the following functions:</p><ul><li>Loading and editing audio</li><li>Recording new tracks</li><li>Mixing and applying effects</li><li>Mastering</li><li>Exporting finished mixes</li></ul><p>After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song.

Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins"></a><strong>2. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins</strong></h3><p>For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG"                      alt="vst plugins"                ></p><p>With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:</p><ul><li>AudioSourceRe</li><li>UNMIX Drums</li><li>XTrax Stem 2</li><li>Drum Extract</li></ul><p>VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.</p><ul><li>4k (cymbals)</li><li>90 Hz (kick drum)</li><li>150 Hz (snare drum)</li></ul><p>Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Edit-Drums-in-Audio-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Edit-Drums-in-Audio-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It usually plays the following functions:</p><ul><li>Loading and editing audio</li><li>Recording new tracks</li><li>Mixing and applying effects</li><li>Mastering</li><li>Exporting finished mixes</li></ul><p>After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song.

Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins"></a><strong>2. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins</strong></h3><p>For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG"                      alt="vst plugins"                ></p><p>With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:</p><ul><li>AudioSourceRe</li><li>UNMIX Drums</li><li>XTrax Stem 2</li><li>Drum Extract</li></ul><p>VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.</p><ul><li>4k (cymbals)</li><li>90 Hz (kick drum)</li><li>150 Hz (snare drum)</li></ul><p>Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Edit-Drums-in-Audio-with-Filmora-1"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Edit-Drums-in-Audio-with-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Import the video and audio files"></a>1. Import the video and audio files</h4><p>Wondershare Filmora has a simplistic and intuitive interface. You can either drag and drop files to the media library directly or click “Import” button to load as many audio or video files as you need. This video editing tool supports a vast range of formats, so you don’t need to worry about any loading problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-source-files.jpg"                      alt="import-source-files"                ></p><h4 id="2-Merge-Video-and-Audio-3"><a href="#2-Merge-Video-and-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Merge Video and Audio"></a>2. Merge Video and Audio</h4><p>After importing your videos to the media library, you can drag-n-drop the video and audio files to the video and audio track respectively. After that, you can align the video with the audio file on the timeline to merge them. Or if you want to replace the audio in the source video with the new audio file, you can right click the video on the track, select Detach Audio, and the original audio from the video will be detached out to the audio track. Then you can delete the detached audio from the track, add your new audio file to the audio track again, and finally align it with the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-detach-audio.jpg"                      alt="filmora9-detach-audio"                ></p><p>Tip: If the audio file needs further editing, just double click it on the audio track, and the audio editing panel will pop up. Then you can adjust the volume, set fade in&#x2F;fade out, tune the pitch and denoise the audio as you like.</p><h4 id="3-Export-the-file-3"><a href="#3-Export-the-file-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Export the file"></a>3. Export the file</h4><p>After aligning the video with the audio on the timeline, hit “Export” to merge them together. You can save it as any file format you like. Besides that, you can also upload the merged video to YouTube directly, or burn to DVD.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

For example, a verified user states that uploading his content to Pexels 4k and Pexels audio has resulted in an influx of high-paying customers.</li></ul><p>So, what is the difference between paid and stock photo sites? Paid content databases such as Shutterstock and Deposit photos require you to create a user ID and subscribe to their service. Conversely, stock photo sites like Pexels.com feature free stock images and videos that you can use with minimal restrictions.</p><p>For example, the site allows you to use its content on YouTube for personal or commercial reasons, provided you make adjustments to the original asset, and you own the video. In addition, the site’s library features content that its contributors share willingly. As such, you can download content from these sites without creating an account or acknowledging the image owner.</p><p>Currently, you can access Pexels through your web browser or download the app on your Android or iOS device. In addition, you can also access the asset library through the Canva application following their merger. Furthermore, you can also download it as a plugin for different content creation software, including Photoshop, MS Office, and Google Slides.</p><h2 id="Part2-What-can-Pexels-provide-you"><a href="#Part2-What-can-Pexels-provide-you" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What can Pexels provide you?"></a>Part2: What can Pexels provide you?</h2><p>Now that you are aware of Pexels.com’s origin story and access methods, here is a rundown of what free access provides you.</p><h3 id="1-4K-images-for-almost-all-topics"><a href="#1-4K-images-for-almost-all-topics" class="headerlink" title="1. 4K images for almost all topics"></a>1. 4K images for almost all topics</h3><p>Pexels.com features a dedicated library of over 40,000 4k images from their contributors.

For example, if you’re making a movie about love and romance, it doesn’t make sense to use a heavy metal song about death and destruction. If you do, then your viewers will find it hard to connect with your movie because they will be distracted by the mismatch between what they see and what they hear.</p><h4 id="2-Pick-songs-that-match-the-genre-of-your-video"><a href="#2-Pick-songs-that-match-the-genre-of-your-video" class="headerlink" title="2.

Keep in mind that there are two types of songs - instrumental and vocal</h4><p>Vocal songs have lyrics that can be sung along while listening to them, whereas instrumental ones don’t have any words but only music in them. It depends on what kind of effect you want to create in your audience’s minds when they listen to it. For example, if you want people to feel happy about something or if it’s about a celebration, then an instrumental one will work better than a vocal one because most people don’t like singing along with instrumental songs since they don’t know what the actual lyrics are.</p><h4 id="5-Think-about-the-emotions-you-want-to-convey"><a href="#5-Think-about-the-emotions-you-want-to-convey" class="headerlink" title="5.

Think about the emotions you want to convey</h4><p>The most important thing when choosing a song is that it matches the emotion of your montage video. For example, if you want to express joyfulness, then you should choose a happy song with a rhythm that can bring up people’s spirits; if you want to express sadness, then you should choose a sad song with an emotional melody; if you want to express anger or hatred, then use heavy metal music; if you want to express love, then use romantic music; etc.</p><p>These are some tips to consider when adding music to your montage videos. Music is an important part of a video montage. It’s the second most important part after the video itself. A good song can make your montage more enjoyable and memorable.

Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Animation"><a href="#7-Animation" class="headerlink" title="7.

It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements-1"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

In addition, photographers submit their images to the platform to allow others to reuse them.</p><p>Pexels’ free download policy allows you to obtain images under the Pexels or Creative common licensing rules. In addition, both licenses allow you to use Pexels images and videos for personal and commercial purposes, provided you make alterations to the original.</p><p>According to the site’s founders, the following are the reasons why the site is free:</p><ul><li>Its main source of revenue is selling advertisement slots to other paid-content databases.</li><li>You can also donate to the website’s operational costs with a single click. In addition, there is no limitation on how much and how often you can donate.</li><li>Most of the site’s contributors do so willingly to increase their brand exposure. For example, a verified user states that uploading his content to Pexels 4k and Pexels audio has resulted in an influx of high-paying customers.</li></ul><p>So, what is the difference between paid and stock photo sites? Paid content databases such as Shutterstock and Deposit photos require you to create a user ID and subscribe to their service. Conversely, stock photo sites like Pexels.com feature free stock images and videos that you can use with minimal restrictions.</p><p>For example, the site allows you to use its content on YouTube for personal or commercial reasons, provided you make adjustments to the original asset, and you own the video. In addition, the site’s library features content that its contributors share willingly.

Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer’s attention and communicate your message. We’ll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Copyright"><a href="#What-Is-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="What Is Copyright?"></a>What Is Copyright?</h2><p>If you are wondering: What is copyright? It’s a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.</p><p>Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.</p><p>If you’re caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you’ll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone’s intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.</p><p>Claiming you didn’t know about the artist’s copyrighted material doesn’t excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.</p><p>If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist’s consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.</p><p>The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.</p><p>For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-15-Non-Copyrighted-Music-for-montages"><a href="#Top-15-Non-Copyrighted-Music-for-montages" class="headerlink" title="Top 15 Non-Copyrighted Music for montages"></a>Top 15 Non-Copyrighted Music for montages</h2><p>If you are looking for free montage music to keep your audience engaged with your content when viewing it, we have highlighted some great options.
