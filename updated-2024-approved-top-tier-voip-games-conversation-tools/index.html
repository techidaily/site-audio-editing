Everyone, especially in this digital world, is trying to make their content as clean as possible, without impurities, for the audiences to watch, enjoy, and stay with the creators. So, you might find it really uncomfortable when you are in this kind of situation. But what you can do, is doable – you can depend on a video denoise software!</p>
<p>There are a lot of online or offline tools you could use to do that, and we have discussed a lot of them on our web-site, and now, we will review yet another way to achieve your desired result when it comes to noise and grain. So, in today’s article, we will touch upon how to AI DeNoise your image!</p>
<p>The case with this intelligent noise reduction for 2022 is that noise reduction software has been the same for over a decade. This is when DeNoise AI comes to play, because its approach is something new – it uses deep learning. The process is lengthy and focuses on learning millions of images, thus let DeNoise AI to accurately distinguish between real image detail and noise. This is so important because with this new technique, now it is possible to denoise images while actually recovering important detail, something that was impossible a few years ago.</p>
<p>Topaz DeNoise AI has a very simple and intuitive interface with different noise removal options. Anyway, using it in the most effective way would require some knowledge. Oh, and, it would be a headache if you have a slow computer!..</p>
<p>So, as mentioned, traditional noise reduction software most of the time reduces the original detail in the images, but DeNoise AI’s noise reduction eliminates noise, meanwhile, preserves the detail and even enhances it. The new update of Topaz DeNoise AI offers different advanced DeNoise AI Models that can be integrated perfectly into your workflow; you can use it as a standalone piece of software or as a plugin for Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-AI-DeNoise-a-file"><a href="#How-to-AI-DeNoise-a-file" class="headerlink" title="How to AI DeNoise a file"></a>How to AI DeNoise a file</h2><p>Let’s just suppose you don’t have the software. So, download and install Topaz DeNoise AI. Go to Topaz Labs and select your operating system: Windows or Macintosh OS. Then, install the program.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-1.jpg"
                      alt="download and install topaz denoise ai"
                ></p>
<p>Once the installation is finished, you will be able to see the Topaz DeNoise AI icon among your applications. Topaz DeNoise AI plugins for Lightroom or Photoshop would also be added there automatically, without any further intervention. But, if that is not the case, it’s ok to add them manually.</p>
<p>The first time you open Topaz DeNoise AI, you can either log in with your Topaz Labs account or try the Denoise AI 30-day free trial.</p>
<p>So, let’s discover how to use DeNoise AI in its different versions!</p>
<p><strong>First, how to remove digital noise with DeNoise AI:</strong> DeNoise AI supports most of the commonly used photography files like raw files, dng, tiff, jpegs, etc. So, open the program, drag or open your image and select the best AI model.</p>
<p>In the upper right corner, you will find a toolbar with these options:</p>
<p><strong>Preview Options:</strong></p>
<p>To change the view mode of the photo you’re working with, you can select:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original (original photo preview)</li>
<li>Single (denoised photo preview).</li>
<li>Split (Original and denoised photo preview with a split slider)</li>
<li>Side by Side ( Original and denoised photo preview)</li>
<li>Comparison ( Compare how the different Ai Models work in your photos at the same time).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Zoom</strong></p>
<p>Zoom in on your images to accurately check the process’s progress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-2.jpg"
                      alt="zoom in on images"
                ></p>
<p>Denoise AI full review and tutorial</p>
<p>On the right side, you’ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>A navigator with the selected zoom box.</li>
<li>A list with the following DeNoise AI Models:</li>
<li>Standard: Broadly developed noise reduction that maintains detail.</li>
<li>Clear: Best for photos with smooth and rounded surfaces such as skin, rocks, water, etc.</li>
<li>Low light: Best for low-light conditions and heavy noise</li>
<li>Severe noise: Best for extremely noisy photos</li>
<li>Raw: The newest AI model in DeNoise. It provides excellent noise reduction, preserving detail, and authentic color starting from a RAW file.</li>
<li>Main Settings. The Auto mode works great in most situations. However, it can be pretty aggressive and give your photos a washed-out look. With Manual Mode, you can set the adjustments according to your taste.</li>
<li>The Post-processing sliders help reduce any color noise remaining in your photos and preserve original detail.</li>
<li>Save Image: To set your output settings before saving your images.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-3.jpg"
                      alt="set output settings"
                ></p>
<p>Then, adjust the setting sliders (you can just select Auto mode here); now, apply the adjustments locally, if necessary, using the mask tool; and, save the file with the output settings selected.</p>
<p><strong>Second, let’ts move to DeNoise AI workflow.</strong></p>
<p>If you are trying to find the simplest way to start with DeNoise Ai, it’s better to use the suggested mode, - Light bulb icon! This will automatically select an AI model, and will do so based oon your image. Anyway, in order to remove digital noise there, it’s the best to use the updated comparison view. The reason is obvious – you can take a look right away and compare varied AI models, or the same ones with some different settings to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-4.jpg"
                      alt="use light bulb icon"
                ></p>
<p>So, how to do just that? Well, select the AI model and fine-tune the adjustment using the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove Noise: This slider is wonderful!. It removes the noise in your photo, but doesn’t kind of wash out the images. Values between 10-50 are the best in most cases.</li>
<li>Enhance Sharpness: It sharpens and recovers the detail in images that may become a bit blurry after denoising. It would be excessive if you set the values over 30, in case you would like to avoid odd textures.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you can refine your results with these DeNoise AI Post-processing adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recover Original Detail: It helps recover some detail that has been washed out after the noise reduction and adds a bit of grain to keep the image natural. 20-40 points is more than enough.</li>
<li>Color Noise Reduction: This is a powerful tool that reduces any color noise remaining in your images. Zoom in on a dark area and adjust the slider until the color noise disappears and you are happy with the result!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And, the last topic to discuss is DeNoise AI Masking Tool!</strong> The software includes a very simple Mask tool in case you want to denoise the image only in certain areas and not in others. So, the key here is that DeNoise AI will apply your adjustments only to the areas that you paint in red.</p>
<p>You need to ckeck the Overlay tool to see the red color while painting. When you are satisfied with the areas you panted, After painting over these areas, you will see a preview of your mask in black and white. Here, white shows the adjustments while black hides them. Following this, DeNoise AI will just be applied to the areas painted in white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-5.jpg"
                      alt="check overlay tool"
                ></p>
<p>And, the masking settings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add&#x2F;Subtract: to paint in white or black and reveal or hide your adjustments.</li>
<li>Size: to change the size of your brush.</li>
<li>Softness: to change the hardness of your brush. Being 0 is the hardest and 100 the softest.</li>
<li>Opacity: to vary the opacity of the mask to add precise local adjustments.</li>
<li>Mask options: to clear or invert your mask.</li>
<li>Overlay: to show in red these areas where you are painting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you finish creating your mask, just click on the “apply mask” button, and there you go!</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can now reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.</p>
<p>Of course, it is much easier than DeNoise AI looks and works, and it’s worth the try – will take so much less minutes!</p>
<h2 id="Bonus-tip-Wondershare-Filmora-audio-denoise"><a href="#Bonus-tip-Wondershare-Filmora-audio-denoise" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise"></a>Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise</h2><p>We already explained how video image and video denoising work, but, denoising not only means digital noise on the screen, of course. It can be literally a noise! The sound which is not so pleasant to listen to… Audio background denoising is to remove unwanted hum from the audio in order for it to become more hearable. So, doing this in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:</p>
<p>Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-8.jpg"
                      alt="drag and drop video into timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the audio track and have access to the editing panel, where you can see Remove background noise – it is not needed to emphasize what this option does for you!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-9.jpg"
                      alt="double click on audio track"
                ></p>
<p>Keep in mind that there is a second way to achieve the same result as well, but this in case you don’t want to detach the audio: Double-click on the video clip in the timeline, the editing panel opens, so switch to Audio. Checking the box next to Remove background noise will show that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, and of course, you can choose to your liking!</p>
<p>If the voice recording doesn’t sound natural anymore, you can do the following: Click on Customize and Customize Equalizer window will open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-10.jpg"
                      alt="click on customize"
                ></p>
<p>On the left, you can see the low tunes, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often on the left, so you can lower them to get rid of them, but in order to have a more natural sound, raise the middle ones a little – and you are done when you are content with the sound!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

So, doing this in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:</p>
<p>Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-8.jpg"
                      alt="drag and drop video into timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the audio track and have access to the editing panel, where you can see Remove background noise – it is not needed to emphasize what this option does for you!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-9.jpg"
                      alt="double click on audio track"
                ></p>
<p>Keep in mind that there is a second way to achieve the same result as well, but this in case you don’t want to detach the audio: Double-click on the video clip in the timeline, the editing panel opens, so switch to Audio. Checking the box next to Remove background noise will show that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, and of course, you can choose to your liking!</p>
<p>If the voice recording doesn’t sound natural anymore, you can do the following: Click on Customize and Customize Equalizer window will open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-10.jpg"
                      alt="click on customize"
                ></p>
<p>On the left, you can see the low tunes, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often on the left, so you can lower them to get rid of them, but in order to have a more natural sound, raise the middle ones a little – and you are done when you are content with the sound!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="lower sound"
                ></p>
<p>So, in this article, you learned about different noises, and about different tools and programs to denoise your images, videos, and audios! Pretty enlightening, ha? Let’s hope this is something you are looking for, and will put to good use very, very soon!</p>
